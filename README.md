Theft by neceſſitie in ſome ſort excuſable, in the prohibition of theft, the cauſes are alſo contained. By this commaundement it is defended to take avvay the honour of another.

      * Still touching the recōmendation of hoſpitalitie and almes.

    _ ¶ There is a double luſt or vnlawfull couetouſneſſe forbidden vs, as the vvife, daughter, or handemayde of our neighbour, by the vvhich is forbidden all fleſhly luſt: and the deſire of the vvealth, honour, and life of any man: this couetouſneſſe is the cauſe of all ſinnes, and the reſiſtaunce of it is a counter defence againſt all ſinnes to our neighbour: meanes to reſiſt it, and not to ſuffer to ſeede any roote of ſinne, for by litle and litle it grovves great, and becomes deſperate againſt all remedies.
 The .11. Chapter.

      * Still touching the recōmendation of hoſpitalitie and almes.

    _ ❧Enumeration of ſinnes wherof men make no conſcience, and are oftentimes in the condicion of greeuous ſinnes: their qualetye and grauetye doo varye according to the matters and obiectes, as lying diſſembling, ſcoffes, flatteries. &c. ❧ The .1. Chapter.

      * Still touching the recōmendation of hoſpitalitie and almes.

    _ ¶ Heare flatterye is declared verye hurtfull to common weales and families: It makes yong People ryſe into great Pride, to furnishe the vvhich they fall into fonde and vvaſtfull expenſes: VVhat is to bee done for the remedye of the ſame.
❧ The .2. Chapter.

      * Still touching the recōmendation of hoſpitalitie and almes.

      * Still touching the recōmendation of hoſpitalitie and almes.

    _ Daunces with their wanton ſonges at this day are vaine and vnchaſte: Muſicke, of an Arte liberall, is conuerted to an vnvvorthy vanity: vvhat Daunces ſhoulde be lavvfull: vvhat Daunces, Muſicke, and Songes vve ought to vſe a examples of holy men, vvho neuer vvould be ſeene in Daunces. ❧ The .6. Chapter.

      * Still touching the recōmendation of hoſpitalitie and almes.

    _ ❧Minſtrels are vnworthy of the ſtate and felowſhip of Townes men, as alſo Puppet Players, and ſuch as are called ſhovves and ſightes. VVhat Harmonie ought to be vſed: Players vvere caſt out of the Church, tyl they had done penaunce: ſuch people corrupt good moralities by vvanton ſhevves and Playes: they ought not to be ſuffred to prophane the Sabboth day in ſuch ſportes, and much leſſe to loſe time on the dayes of trauayle: All diſſolute playes ought to be forbidden: All comicall and Tragicall ſhovves of ſchollers in Morall doctrines, and declamations in cauſes made to reprooue and accuſe vice, and extoll vertue, are very profitable. ❧ The .7. Chapter.

      * Still touching the recōmendation of hoſpitalitie and almes.

    _ ¶ The Ritche ſort haue more to trauaile then the poore, and in what: Such as labour in mind, trauaile more then the painefull labourer. A proofe hovve idlenes is the cauſe of other euilles: Idle men are malice dreamers: Exhortacion not to follovve idlenes: Exhortacion to trauaile by apte compariſions, vvherein idle Beaſtes are expulſed from the ſocietye of others that trauaile. The .9. Chapter.

      * Still touching the recōmendation of hoſpitalitie and almes.

    _ ❧Gouernors ought not to ſuffer any ydle men in their commonweales, vvho as they be vnprofitable, and a charge to the vvorlde, ſo in the ende they bring ruine to their commonvveales: therefore it is neceſſary that fathers put their children to ſome trade, and maſters their ſeruants, and ſo all others.

Chapter.

      * Still touching the recōmendation of hoſpitalitie and almes.

    _ ❧Loyterers accuſtomed to beg, vvill be applyed to no other trade: The poore religious beggers ought to be entertayned by them in vvhoſe ſeruice they trauell, as Byshops and Pastors: Hermittes ought to trauell according to their fyrſt institution: the Hermites of Thebaides in Aegypt of their trauels nourished the poore the vvell reformed religion trauell certaine hovvers of the day. ❧The .13. Chapter.

      * Still touching the recōmendation of hoſpitalitie and almes.

    _ ¶ Many haue giuen all that they had to the poore to follow Ieſus Chriſt, in hope to be happie: ſo did the first christians leaue all their goodes: God requireth not of euery one ſuch a feruent liberality, but to giue by moderation, vvhich is at the leaſt, their ſuperfluitye.
