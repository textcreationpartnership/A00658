            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2096:3"/> they ſuffer alteration by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and in the end ſlyde into vices and imperfections, which breede the reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucions and ruines of all estates. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can not be entertained, if it bee not backt with ciuill Iustice, which, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocallie hath need of a deuout pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for that as Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is iust, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of it ſelfe, is holy and religious: ſo thei are the two estates which the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture names the true foundacions and pillors of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales. They embrace and kiſse one another, and (as <hi>Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates twyns</hi>) they ar ſick togither, &amp; well togither, they laugh togither and weep togither, and ſuffer in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like &amp; ſelf affections: Ther is nothing neceſſary to the one, which is not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the other, nor any thing meete for the one which is not made worthie

Many auncient Magistrates therefore, foreſeeing the neceſsitie of Monarchies to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected vpon theſe two pillors, conſulted to raiſe ordonances for the perpetuall continuance of the Church and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weal in one indiſſoluble vnitie: of thoſe ſome followed <hi>Moyſes,</hi> who as he was inſpired of God, and perſwaded the people of <hi>Iſraell</hi> to be obedient to him: ſo that eternall Lorde ſent them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaundementes to establish the actions of their mindes: and rates of

               <p>By the Goſpell he vnderſtandes all doctrine of health, of grace, and of promiſe for remiſſion of ſinnes, whereof Ieſus Chriſt is the aucthour: where he ſaith, <hi>Happy are they that heare the worde of God,</hi> he addeth this text, <hi>and do kepe it:</hi> wherein be comprehended the ſtatutes and ordinaunces which the Apoſtles haue taught, which we call traditions, as beyng recommended vnto them by the holy ſpirite of Ieſus Chriſt to his Church.</p>

Recompence is due to labour, the hiered man ought to bée nouriſhed with the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the Vine, and eate of the fruite: he that fighteth in warre, ought to receaue his paye: he that féedes the flocke, ought to take the Mylke and the Fléeſe: and he that trauayles in the Temple, and the Goſpell, deſerues to liue by it. Preſidentes and Counſellours receiue not their wages if they do not their office: then by what collour of right in conſcience or common reaſon, can he demaunde any rewarde, which bringes foorth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſhow, yea he is but an impediment to others in whom is more abilitie and better merite.

               <p>Touching our worldly Philoſophers, who ſaye that ſince ſermons haue béene ſo rife and common, all hath beene marred: I ſay on the contrarye, that if there had béen diligence and plenty of Preachers in al Churches, that the Chaires and Pulpets had neuer béene voyde of Paſtours, as they haue béen theſe fiftye yéeres: men had not nowe knowen what hereſie is. If the foolde had béen wel kept, the Wolfe had not entered, yea, hée had beene

And when ſome begonne to preache the Goſpell accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſimple letter, all the worlde for the newnes ronne to it with great affection: wherin this euil is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that ſuch as would vndertake to preache &amp; teach, were men of paſſions, enuiors of the Clergie, Apoſtats, and of a wil depraued: they in ſome ſorte adultered and corrupted by collour of Religion, and with theyr intiſing eloquence, the trueth of the Goſpell, and vnder Hony, they haue cauſed poyſon to bée founde good: Wherunto muſt bée applied an <hi>Antidot</hi> by Preaching of ſincere Doctrine, and reforming theyr diſſolute and infamous liues: which if it had béene done, there is no doubte but trueth had eaſely ſupplanted falſhod, (corruption of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being ſo annexed to the ſinceritye of Doctrine.) Let therfore ſuch Curates as will not allow Sermons, geue place to theſe reaſons and chaunge iudgement: And let them not tarye the aſſaults of the enemies, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide in oportunitye, and prepare theyr pariſhoners (by the meanes which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aduiſeth <hi>Titus</hi> to fight with Heretikes),<note place="margin">Titus. 1.</note> geuing them ſuche courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancye as they can not bée ſhaked.

By this it happeneth that the Catholikes hearing no doctrine afore, receaue eaſily falſe Prophets when they beginne to Preache, the rather when they pronounce that they are the meſſengers of health and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life: Where, if the ſimple multitude had been

But in this caſe, it is no office of the Paſtour or Prieſt to crye out of them with imputations of Hereſy, thinking they are well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged when they haue diſcharged theyr coller againſt them: No let them rather ſtudy and practiſe the meanes to conuert them, and praying to God for them, let them take héede that others that yet doo ſtande, fall not into ſuch errours.</p>

               <p>To the wiſedome of a Phiſition, is required an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyte iudgement, whiche is made perfect by experience, wherin, by neceſſary reaſon they ought to haue good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſéeing they haue the life of al ſortes of men in iudgement, with power to diſpoſe without appeale to any higher Iudges but to God: where to all other inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Courtes belonges this prorogatiue: That albeit the Iudges bée neuer ſo wiſe, yet there is liberty to appeale to higher places.</p>
               <p>And if in a common conſult &amp; aſſembly of Phiſitions to debate vpon a diſeaſe, there can bée no good reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where is no grauety of learning &amp; experience, much leſſe ought a yong phiſition to bée receyued, whoſe want of practiſe takes from him the eſtimation of iudgement and experience: So that it is highly neceſſary to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of a Phiſition, to ſtudy the time appointed, and duly runne ouer the thrée thinges aforeſayde.

Let them honour their beginnings with the preſence and teſtimony of the beſt Cities, drawing their practiſe from the example of the moſt excellent in that arte. And making profe of their learning, by publike diſputes and aucthority of auncient profeſſours, let them ſhewe Certificate of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of their ſtudie, and time of their Degrées: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it maye bée ſayde, that in regarde of the time of this Studye, it is neceſſarye that ſuche as Aſpire to the Arte, bée eyther verye Ritche, or at leaſt furniſhed to beare out ſo chargeable a Coſt: I muſt in déede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that, that common weale ſuffereth great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neience, wherein the poore ſort make profeſſion of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke: For, as pouerty being voide of power to releue the time of ſo long ſtudie, hath leſſe meane to furniſhe other neceſſary charges, as Bookes, whereof they muſt haue great ſtoore for the due ſearching out of the ſecréetes of that Arte: So it is for the moſt part gréedye of Gaine, aſpiring to wealth, wherſoeuer they may finde it: And being neuer ſatiſfied, they fall, by increaſe of newe and freſhe profite, into extréeme auarice.

               <p>There be alſo of them which ſell this for that, againſt whom is no leſſe rigour to be vſed, then to thoſe lewde Notaries which in writings of importaunce, wyll vſe <hi>etcetera.</hi> In theſe men, the Phiſitions reappoſe great truſt, touching the receiptes which they ſende to them, wherein their negligence bringes no ſmall offence, for that they ought to ſee the Droages, to the ende there bee no ſuppoſition which may ſende the patient to his laſt ende.

               <p>There is alſo another abuſe no leſſe daungerous, which is the corruption of Droages, by their long and negligent keping, by which corruption, as Phiſicke is turned into poyſon, and the facultie to cure, into mortall perill of life: So in this, expert Phiſitions haunting Shoppes, are ſo much the more to blame, by how much they forbeare to caſt ſuch poyſons into Sinke holes, (for, to throw them into Riuers, were to infect the Fiſh) but it hapneth that the Phiſition is either goſſop, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, friend or parent to this pratling Pothicarie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tromperie ſhall not be diſcouered, yea, it behooueth

               <p>The ignoraunt knoweth not what to ſaye to it, who much leſſe that hée can comprehende the abuſe, ſéeing of the contrarye, hée is often taught by the Pothicarye to preſcribe his receiptes, and compounde his Droages.

               <p>But to preuent ignoraunce, it were expedient not to receyue any profeſſour of that Arte, without good proofe of his knowledge, and exact examination of the reſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his reſolute ſufficiencye: Let him bée ſworne not to abuſe the Arte to the hurt of any, nor ſuffer his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes vnder him to vndertake any Cure, eyther in the Citye or Countrey, without his commaundement and Counſell, as both to ſearche truelye the ſtate of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and appoint due reméedye, calling if néede require the aſſiſtaunce of the Phiſition, but not as ſome doo, who hauing a Phiſition friende, doo call him rather for theyr common gaine, then for any neceſſitye of the diſeaſe, which is a ſuttle.

I wiſhe in God, that touching Preaching, no man might be admitted to that eſtate, without the ſtudy of ten or twelue yeres in holy Scripture, ioyning with all the conference of Lectures and Leſſons of learned men: as alſo I woulde that in the Vniuerſities, none ſhoulde be receiued into the degrées of Doctours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proofe of ſo long time ſtudie after he be admitted to the ſtate of Maiſter of Arte, wherein if they haue not ſtudied ſeriuſlye, or haue aſpired to the degrees by fraud and ſuppoſition of witneſſes, or if they haue conuerted to other exerciſe, the time that ſhoulde haue béen reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſearche out that knowledge, they committed wrong, chiefly to God, with whom it is not lawfull for any to enter into degrée and aucthoritie to teache, if hée be not expert in all his Lawe. To this may be ioyned the prouidence of the elders, by whom it was ordeyned
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2096:32"/> that in this caſe none ſhoulde employ time in other ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die then in the Scriptures, to the ende that beyng re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in that knowledge, the worlde ſhoulde not bée led in errours and falſe doctrines. It were therefore a good order to be obſerued in Vniuerſities and places of congregation, not to ſende any young Preachers or Nouiſes into the countrey, before they haue expreſſed their doctrine afore the auncientes and multitude of the religion, &amp; that in the ſame expoſition wherin they muſt teache their congregation abroade, neither adding nor diminiſhing when they ſhall preache to the multitude: For other wayes there were daunger, that without this long cuſtome or diligent exerciſe of priuate preaching, theſe young prentiſes woulde deliuer to their audience ſuttle and falſe propoſitions, which we call either vaine doctrines, or heretical, although they helde them without any wicked or peruerſe wyll: Beſides, hauing once pronounced them, they woulde be aſhamed to renounce them, and ſo the people in the meane while ſhould ſtand ſeduced: And if they do renownce them, the multitude woulde not afterwarde beléeue them eaſily, becauſe in opinion they woulde holde that they were conſtrayned to denie them, as we reade that <hi>Berengarius</hi> was not able to reduce thoſe, whom he had ſeduced by ignorance: So that, as there woulde be alwayes feare of ſome errour, ſo it coulde not be without blaſphemie to the trueth of the Scripture, to ſuppoſe in place of the ſame, a falſehood, and that in the Pulpit, which being the ſeate of trueth, ſuch as are appointed to pronounce it, ought to haue knowledge of good iudgement, great wiſedome, perfect vnderſtanding, and holy affection, pretending no other ende or purpoſe but the honour of God, and health of ſoules, without aſpiring to particuler glorie, ſéeing all glorie is due to God: Let them beare no affection to couetouſneſſe, and much leſſe to pleaſe men, but ſtudie and preach to edifie, forbearing for malice to any ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2096:32"/> perſon, to exhibite bityng inuectiues in generall ſpeache, and leſſe againſt eſtates.</p>
               <p>Here, when we ſpeake of Preachers, who ought to be ſuch in all perfection of excellencie, we meane Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and Paſtours, which by the charge and duetie of their Paſtorall profeſſion, are actuallye bounde to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that eſtate: For as all other Preachers are but their Vicars, ſo if it belong to the Curate to be no leſſe learned then his Vicar, is it not then contrary to all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and reaſon, that he ſhoulde be raiſed into eſtate and dignitie aboue others, if he expreſſe not greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as in wiſedome, doctrine, experience, and vertue? Why is the head rayſed aboue the other members of the body, but becauſe he is endued with more excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of nature?</p>
               <p>I wiſhe that none ſhoulde make practiſe of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion without knowledge of all the Scripture, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute interpretation of the holy Doctours, which if it had béen obſerued in the firſt inſtitution, the Church had béen repleniſhed with learned and feruent Paſtours, Neither had the worlde ſwarmed with theſe newe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, if they had well ſtudied and obſerued the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the Church.

               <p>But when theſe wretched Sycke men are (as it were) at theyr laſte, and abandoned of theyr Phiſytions, then God is brought into theyr remembraunce, when the Spirites being weake, the Sences diſſolued, the hearing without vertue, and the heart languiſhing to his laſte, hée hath no iudgement of that which is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to him, but what ſo euer ſtoode in his affection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, bee it good or ill, hée retaynes it, and the minde hauing no Capacitye to comprehende Doctrine, is without regarde to call it ſelfe to account or correction, whereby it happeneth by the Iuſtice of God according to Sainct <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that, that almightye and terrible Iudge doeth puniſhe the Synner in the ende of his dayes, becauſe during his health and good diſpoſition hee liued in negligence towardes God, and neuer gathered the actions of his life into accounte: It is ſaide that as in death men haue no remembrance of God, ſo the feare of death and hell, more then the loue of God, makes men oftentimes confeſſing their ſinnes, for touching the will, there is more daunger that ſinne will leaue man, then man renounce ſinne.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:2096:34"/>
               <p>So that by the waye of aduertiſement, let as well the Phiſition as the patient bee warned heare, to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite the dutye of Chriſtians, and not to grudge if I dooe exhorte them, for that hauing in hande to wryte a Chriſtian gouernement and Pollecye, I can not (without offence) diſſemble any thing whiche tendes to common dutye in thinges concerning God.</p>
               <p>Therefore I aduiſe the ſicke man, ſo ſoone as hée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendes the mocion and qualitye of his diſeaſe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathe himſelfe altogeather to God, and conſulte with his Soule: For ſuche maye bée the furye and violent nature of his Sickeneſſe, that what for debilitye of bodye, or ſorrowe of minde, or other accident of infirmitye, muche leſſe that hée ſhall haue oportunitye to common with his Conſcience, but of the contrarye power ſhal be taken from him to diſcerne in what ſtate hée ſtandes.</p>
               <p>It is not good that euerye one make a Cuſtome and common recourſe to Phiſicke, reducing the diſpoſition of theyr Stomackes to a Pothicarye ſhoppe, the ſame agréeing with the preſcript of the beſt Phiſitions of our tyme, who aboue all thinges geue this generall counſayle, that men diſpoſe theyr lyues in ſobrye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, forbeare Exceſſe, and not to become ſubiect to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate affections, as to bee geuen to anger, to heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of heart, and to the actes of vnchaſte loue.

Therfore let euery one tye him ſelfe to good Regiment, to temperate labour, to wholſome meates, ſound Ayre, ſweete water, cleane Places: But aboue al, let him eſchewe the ſweete allurement to ſinne: And when wée offend God, let our firſt cure ſtand in action of penaunce, and after vſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of minde, and not to gréeue for any thing that may happen, as in déede the faithfull Chriſtian ought neuer diſcend into ſorrow but for his ſinne, but hath cauſe to reioyce in al aduerſity, ſicknes, yea, and in death it ſelfe, for that (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth) in al theſe thinges is wrought the matter of his benefite and health, as thinking that al the paſſions and tribulations of this fraile and humane life are not worthy of the eternall glory which he hopes for in Heauen, wherof hée aſſureth him ſelfe, for that by how much hée endureth afflictions heare in earth, by ſo much is his glory layd vp the greater, and he made more happy in heauen, in which conſideration onely S. <hi>Paul</hi> toke comfort in perplexityes, Torments, Extreme mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeryes, and in the Croſſe, wherin hée reioyſed more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually (as al the other Saints did) then the fleſhly men in all theyr banquets, pleaſures, and idle delights of the world. Let therfore the Chriſtian pacient, after the due action of penaunce &amp; ſubmiſſion for his faultes, reioyce him ſelfe in his ſicknes with ſinging of pſalmes and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye himnes, hauing alſo inſtruments of muſicke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto hée maye ſing deuout Notes, or haue them ſong in his preſence, to raiſe his heart and ſpirite into ſpirituall ioye in the Lord, in which ſort S. <hi>Paul</hi> willeth men to diſpoſe theyr paſtimes of the worlde, as alſo S. <hi>Iames,</hi> in all euents and dollerous accidents, counſelles men to relieue theyr hearts with the ſolace of Pſalmes, vſing in caſes of ſicknes, and times of aduerſity, (with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> when hée was ſicke) the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Bookes of conſolation and ſpiritual Doctrines,

               <p>But now to knit vp eftſones with the matter of the Phiſitions, who in many partes of Chriſtendome, are worſe diſpoſed then thoſe whome wée named before, as being readye miniſters, eyther for hate or couetouſnes, fauour or hyre, to murder and ſell the liues of theyr mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable pacients by horrible meanes, too familiar in the world now a dayes, to whoſe vnnaturall treaſons, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the tormentes of hell to bée but a due iuſtice.

               <p>There is an other ſort, in whome is litle difference of

               <p>Thus they abuſe the arte, which being a gift of God, they become vnfaithfull, and vnthankefull miniſters, againſt his honour, will, and commaundement, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God more then they, who by theyr counſell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuche wicked actes: Suche alſo as kéepe patientes long on theyr handes, and Surgeons, who for gaine and practiſe, nouriſhe long time Vlcers, Woundes, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes, as in theyr doing is expreſſed an imitacion of Théeues, ſo what can they deſerue leſſe then the reward of that crime.</p>

Let them vſe ſuche aucthoritie, as they maye make tremble the whole worlde vnder them, ſpecially the euyll lyuers, and conteine others in office of good conuerſation. For this cauſe the Eccleſiaſtike aduiſeth vs to take héede to aſpire to the ſtate of iudging, if we haue not the courage and power to breake the iniquities of all ſortes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſéeing if we feare the force of the mightie, we ſhall feare to do good iuſtice, and ſo bring Sclaunder to our light deſire of ſouerentie: but as in good iudges God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaieth ſome beames of his deuinitie, as being the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his deuine iuſtice, ſo he ioynes to their office the operation of ſome deuine vertue which makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feared of their ſubiectes.

               <p>Touching falſe witneſſe, forbidden and expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by God to death, it is conſequent and conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to theft, at the leaſt, it tendeth to one common ende with it, and procéedes of one Roote, which is couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though ſome times it deriues of malice, or ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wil of reuenge, or hath ſome other wicked purpoſe.

               <p>The remedyes are, fayth, holy doctrine, continuall prayer, and aſſiſtaunce of the holy ſpirite inſpiryng into our heartes ſecrete mocions to do well, together with diligent exerciſe of vertue, and ſtudie of moral and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike diſciplines, by the which we are enterteyned Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilly in a ſtate of common duetie towardes our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and common weale.

But according to Chriſtianity, we ought not to ſcoffe at the vices of another, but to ſhewe compaſſion &amp; praye to God for him that erreth, applying correction by ſuch meanes as wée may: which if it bring forth no fruite to his amendment, at the leaſt let vs with <hi>Samuel</hi> weepe for the vices of <hi>Saul,</hi> and pray to God for pardon for him. Charitye (ſayth the Scripture) couereth faultes, &amp; neither reuealeth nor reioyſeth in them, no more then the natural amitie of the humane bodye ſuffreth that one member put out to publike ſhowe an apoſtume which is in any part of the reſt of the body: &amp; if it bée already in the outward parts, ſhée couereth it by ſuch meanes as ſhée can, that it appeare not ignominiouſlye. If Libels of diffamation bée puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with rigorous paine, why ſhould publike ſclanders on ſcaffoldes eſcape the ſentence, where euery eare is open, &amp; frée liberty of iudgement?

That it is a great vice, it is certaine by the text of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> who calles it iniquity, the cauſe properly of the ruine of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorre,</hi> &amp; ſcourge of the Iſraelites. It is iniquitye, becauſe it is againſt the Lawe &amp; deuine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce, by the which it is ſayde to man: <hi>Thou shalt eate thy bread with the ſweate of thy browes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> As who ſaye, ſo muche ſhalt thou trauaile al the daies of thy life in the labours of thy profeſſion, or arte that thou ſhalt take in hand, as thou ſhalt ſweate to gaine thy liuing, wherein as by this law al men are condemned for ſinne: ſo it behoueth euerye one, howe Ritche ſo euer he bée, or what power or principalitye ſo euer he poſſeſſe, to obeye the lawe and this ordinaunce, otherwaies he is a tranſgreſſour of the lawe, and puniſhable as an offendur: it is therfore that S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, that all men ought to trauaile, condemning the loyterour not to bée worthy to liue: and with all exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates al idle people, calling them diſordered, becauſe they are not in the order polletike, where all the worlde accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theyr perticular vocation, doth trauaile, and none is founde vnprofitable: euen as in the natural body, which ſuffereth no part or member to be Idle, but all ſeruing an vſe in their body, do trauaile in their humane functions.</p>
               <p>If no man bée excommunicated but for ſome great crime,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2096:83"/> ſéeing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> excommunicated Idle people, they can not be but very criminal: God hath ordained labour as a penaunce to man, and to be to him as a remembraunce of the wretchednes which ſinne bringeth, an exerciſe to kéepe him in vertue, and a meane to traine him to humility and dutye, according to the arte whereunto hée is called, by the which his ſpirite is drawn from wicked thoughts, corrupt affections, and reprobate deſires, wherwith the Idle man is continuallye vexed. For this cauſe S. <hi>Ierome</hi> biddes vs bée doing alwaies ſome worke,<note place="margin">Pro. 2.</note> to the ende the Deuil may finde vs occupied. Beſides this, moderate labour is very profitable to the health of the body, without the which by crudity and indigeſtion of humours &amp; retaining the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, many diſeaſes may bréede. And therfore, who wil not bende his body to labour, ſhould in the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe reaſons, commit great faultes againſt God, againſt him ſelfe, &amp; againſt his common weale, wherunto hée is bound with al his meane and power. For as (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reſemblance before) there is no member in the humane bodye, which trauailes not according to the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of his nature and office, to geue ayde to the general bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye and euery member in perticular, which otherwayes would fal into infirmitye: yea, if it ſhould perſeuere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out geuing ſuccors, and bréede hurt by contagion, it ſhould bée cut of from the body, not onely as vnprofitable, but as a corruptor of the other members: ſo, what leſſe office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes to the member of this body polletike? Deſerueth hée not that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> geues to the idle <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> to bée cut of and excluded from Chriſtian ſociety? And if Ieſus Chriſt condemne an idle worde (that is bringing no profite to our neighbour) to the iudgement of God, what ſentence may bée geuen of ſuche, as not onelye liue in idle wordes, but loaſe theyr precious time, and omitting innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable good déedes, ſtand idle &amp; vnprofitable euen in their proper vocation? If any wil ſaye, that in this idlenes men offende not, for that they doo but walke, talke, ſléepe, make méerye, &amp; paſſe the time without doing euil to any, hauing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2096:84"/> withall whereupon to liue without trauaile: it maye bée denyed for the firſt part of the aunſwere, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but doo euill, for that as ſuche lyfe and Paſtimes are reprooued, and that in all times, and for all our workes and wordes, wée are bounde to geue accoumpt to God.</p>
               <p>So, it is not inough to abſtaine from doing euill, but wée muſt alſo without ceaſſing bée exerciſed in doing good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture. So that the Ritche man muſt not ſay, I haue inough and néede not take paine: Nor the Gentleman muſt not vaunte of his great reuenues, &amp; ſay hée hath no further care but to paſſe his time in hunting and other delites: Nor let the Biſhop and Churchman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him ſelfe of trauaile, for that his liuing is plentifull and prepared to his handes: For euery man is bounde to followe his vocation, and walke (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame: Hée muſt not ſléepe then in that voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if his office bée to trauaile, and that with as great diligence as he maye, euen no leſſe then belonges to him that hath vndertaken for ſome neceſſary affaires, to make ſome painefull iourney.</p>
               <p>Let ſuche people (whome God hath bleſſed with ſuche wealthe, as to maintaine theyr life, there is no neceſſitye of labour,) conſider why they were rayſed to ſuch Ritch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates: who, the more they haue, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater reckoning haue they to make to God, &amp; are ſubiect to more déedes of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye then others. In this I bind not al ſorts of men to a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of trauaile with the hand in workes of labour: But as there be diuerſe ſorts of trauailes, ſome of the minde, and ſome of the body: So, to ſome kindes of labor is required, ſometimes the ſtrayning of the bodye, and ſometime the exerciſe of the minde.</p>
               <p>The Ritch man hath his part of trauaile to direct his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, &amp; kéepe his ſeruantes in office, wherin, let him with <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeeke out in the high wayes poore paſſangers, &amp; about his houſe his néedy neighbors, imparting vnto them of his goodes geuen him by God for that ende.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman hath inough to prouide for the quiet of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2096:84"/> his Tenauntes, that they conſume not one another with ſutes, and to defend them from the oppreſſion of the théefe or enemye: hée ought to bée to them as a ſhéephearde to his flocke, whoſe office is not onelye to defend them from the Iawes of the Wolfe, but alſo ſo to leade them as they doo no hurt to the ſeuerall Féeldes of another:</p>
               <p>But in warre the Gentleman is bounde, for the publike defence of his Countrey, to commit his perſon to hazarde: So that, whether in peace or in warre, the Gentleman hauing due regarde to the diſcharge of his office and eſtate, hath no leaſure to leade or loaſe his time in Idlenes: What belongeth then to the Magiſtrate Polletike, who likewiſe is a paſtour of his people, to guide them ciuilly by counſell, to kéepe them according to the Lawe, to defende them with his aucthoritye, and vſe ſuch prouidence as they bée not moleſted? But much more, yea moſt of all, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the ſpirituall paſtour of Soules, the churchman of what order ſoeuer he bée, to bée vigelaunt in his eſtate, as hauing in charge farre more precious thinges then the others, &amp; of a greater perrill if he loaſe them: for in looſing one Soule (being ſo deare to Chriſt as he gaue his life for it) he loſeth alſo his owne and can not bée ſaued,<note place="margin">Ezech. 3.34.</note> if onelye one bée ſpilt thorow his default: Right ſtraitely therefore is he bound to pray inceſſauntly, to preache diligently, and to ſhow holy conuerſation in his office: who, if he loſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoules eyther by his example, or through his falſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or by negligence in his duty, incurreth horrible dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that in loſing a Soule, hée ſuffereth to bée loſt and ſpilt the blood of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus as there is no man, who, notwithſtanding his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencye of wealthe, hath not occaſion to trauaile more then others, whome neceſſitye enforceth to paynes for theyr reléefe: ſo, the more hée is bounde to God for his wealthe, by ſo muche more is hée ſtrayned to geue recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to God of the diſtribution of it. And therefore if any ſaye vnto you, you haue inough to lyue vppon without trauaile, tell him he is eyther a flatterer, or verye
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2096:85"/> ignoraunt, not knowing that God by his intollerable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce hath bounde vs al to trauaile without excepting any, creating and apointing vs to labour, as hée hath made the birdes to flye ſayth <hi>Iob:</hi>

By which occaſion within few dayes all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers became feble &amp; weake, yea without hability to moue, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man had no power to ſet one foote before another. And ſo foreſeeing in what danger of death hée ſtode, for not miniſtring foode to his ſtomacke and bellye, perſwaded al his members eftſones to recontinue their trauaile, geuing them to vnderſtand that they were not fallen into that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity by any other meanes then becauſe they diſobeyed the ſtomacke, refraining fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trauaile to prouide him ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and norriture to the bellie: which being thus beaten into theyr knowledge, they tooke againe theyr firſt office, labour, and diligence, and ſo eftſones recouered theyr agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litye and force, &amp; neuer afterwards mutined againſt their ſtomackes or belly.

<pb facs="tcp:2096:109"/> and ſocyetye of friendſhippe not to be neglected, as is alſo to giue preſents and doe pleaſure to our friendes and Lordes: Ieſus Chriſt ſayth it is no act of vertue meritorious afore God, for that no actes, but ſuch as are done in his name, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue recompence of him. The poore criminall offenders knowne to be in pryſon by ſlaunder and falſe witneſſe, and in perill of execution if they be not reſkued, as they ought by the ſcryptures to be deliuered by all meanes, leaſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud be ſpilt which may bring common wretchedneſſe vpon all ſuch as might haue deliuered them: ſo ſuch as haue deſerued death iudicially determined by full euidence, aſſone as they haue committed the cryme, owe a death to God in good iuſtice, &amp; to their common weale for examplary inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is but one iuſt cauſe of delay, which is to appeach their confederates, and to affront them: otherwiſe all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes of iuſtice (ſayth <hi>Plato</hi>) are ſignes of corruption in the Iudges, who by delaying of iudgement, giue oportunity to the party to reclayme grace in time, or to compound with the aduerſary, or to bring the facte in forgetfulneſſe, or at leaſt to qualifie the rigour of the party offended, or laſt of all (aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſtill to be deliuered) to gette committed to the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Galleyes, the malefactor in whome is full merite of penall death: In which fauour, beſides the iniuſtice and damnable corruption, is bred the occaſion of many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, as the reuenge of them that perſecuted his lyfe, with an vnbrideled lycence to do any euill.

A Colledge or ſchole is the foundaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; floriſhing braunches of a common weale, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtoare houſe of all knowledge, the faſhioner of all young wittes, a pure fountaine purging all corrupte natures, and as a forme or moule of all aſwel humaine as diuine perfections: it is a welſpring of ſcience, and fountaine of all vertue: it is the houſe of diſcipline, the manſion of the Muſes, their <hi>Hellicon</hi> and <hi>Pernaſsus,</hi> and the fortreſſe of <hi>Pallas:</hi> it is the place wherein is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the firſt exerciſe of doctrine, chriſtian life, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2096:110"/> of pietie: yea it is the ornament and glorie of Cities, a bulwarke to Borowes, &amp; to vplandiſh townes of the fielden and the very beginning, continuance, and piller of Religion. Thus Colleages, being the cauſes and perfect effectes of ſo many benefites, deſerue alſo (without compariſon) more ſingular recommendacion then all the hoſpitalles of the world: For in Colleges or Scholes are nouriſhed and poliſhed the mindes of men, being the diuine, heauenly &amp; immortall purtraits of the diuinitie of God, and in hoſpitalles only the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and mortal bodies of decayed men are fed and cheriſhed. In Colleges alſo poore children may bee ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, if the houſes haue liberal dowries, the ſame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring great cauſe to the gouernours to prouide Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, ſéeing alſo it is a common intereſt to all men to ſée to the good inſtruction and education of youth, what courſe of ſcience ſo euer they take, as hauing no abilitie of them ſelues to know what is good, honeſt, profitable nor what is conducible to the ſafetie of their ſoules, and much leſſe to diſcerne God and ſearche out his wil: yea they ſhal be ignorant in their rule and gouernment of humaine reaſon (ſo wicked and obſcure a nature car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie they by ſinnes) ſo ignorant is their ſpirit, ſo peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their will and affections, whereby thoſe children fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing time, without diſcipline and inſtitution, ſhould fall into infinit errours and diſſolute manners: and as vice encreaſeth as the wicked wéede groweth without culture or labor, and euery minde by his proper nature caried to doe euill, where vertues can not bee attained without diſcipline and inſtruction: ſo, theſe young for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward plantes if thei ſhould not be licorred with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome moyſture and moderated by the induſtrie of ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workmen, they would bring forth fruites of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and troubles to their common weales, and in the end ouergrow them to their generall deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Let it be therefore a principall care in chief Rulers, to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2096:110"/> erect Colledges, building them in places ayrie, cleane, and faire, obſeruing the commoditie of the Sunne and wind reflecting temperatly (a thing very delightful to the wit, and profitable to the health of the body) foreſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they carrie ſuch ſtate in ſhowe and buildinge, that aſwell the beauty of the workmanſhip as the ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the place, may draw children of noble houſes to paſſe their youth there, and inuite other good wittes to eſtabliſhe and follow the ſtudie of learning: The romthes ſtanding in ſuch amplitude, and the chambers ſo many, that they may conueniently conteyne the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſchollers within the houſe (being very hurtfull by many reaſons to make ſeparation of ſtudentes one from another) and vnder the chambers to bee made formes, to the ende the Regentes and maiſters remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the ſaid chambers, and hauing vnder them the ſaid fourmes may better kéepe their ſchollers in dutie, then if their fourmes were elſwhere beſtowed: if the place be commodious, it is neceſſary to make libraries in the ſayde chambers, which would bée very requiſite for good Studentes (for to yonge children and ſuch as beare no vehement will to ſtudie they would be but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to hinder or diſorder their exerciſe) it were good they were beſtowed in a mild, ſwéete and ſofte aier (if the place beare commodity) for the recreation and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of wittes: the windowes of theſe ought to haue aſpect towardes the Eaſt and Weſt, for the South re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth the wit and dulleth it and filles the braine with hurtfull vapour: and the wind of the North (as in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when it is cold) hindreth the memory, and is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the lyuer and lightes, becauſe it ſtirres vppe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a Colledge or ſchole ought to bee indued with reuenue ſufficient to entertaine a principall and Regentes of ſingular vertue and knoweledge with wages accordinge to their order and qualitie, and that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2096:111"/> with ſuch iuſt payment, that they haue no occaſion to complaine of their common weale, nor of ſuch by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are called to the exerciſe of that profeſſion. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reuenues of Colledges (without the which the ſtately buildings ſhould ſéeme as cages wherin the birdes died of hunger for want of prouiſion: goodly to beholde, but not to dwell there) the Church in other tymes hath prouided for her part a principall Regent: for which purpoſe ſhée leauied foure or fiue hundreth Frankes of eſtate in the Cathedrall Churches for the finding of a man of excellent learning, and vertuous life, who at this day retaynes the name called Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, and the Biſhops and common weales ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſte as thei ſaw neceſſitie require: wherein for the default of ſome of our predeceſſours diſcontinuinge this good and holy inſtitution, I wiſh our Eccleſiaſtical prelates of this time (to reſtore and recontinue ſo aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and neceſſarie conſtitution) would, where neede is, either erect newe Colledges and encreaſe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenew, or at leaſt repaire ſuch as are towardes ruine, and of their groſſe reuenues (ſuperfluous for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a churchman) compart ſome porcion to the fauour of learning, honour of God, ſeruice of their countrey, and their owne perpetuall memorie: and as thoſe holy and graue prelates of the former tymes ſaw there were no better meanes to preuent hereſies, and correct vices, then by laying a ground of good inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the firſt yeares of youth: ſo, if their ſucceſſours had ſuccéeded them aſwel in example and imitation, as in their huge and wealthie liuinges, they had ſtopped the courſe to many ſectes and opinions, which only are the cauſe at this day that Chriſtendome ſtandeth deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in religion, and the kinges thereof drawen into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of mutuall conſpiracie. In ſome places, common weales and cities onely, haue had the honor to builde &amp; endue Colleges with a reuenue of a thouſand or xii. C.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2096:111"/> Frankes at the leaſt, for the which they haue bene and are amongeſt all other cities moſt celebrated. Others not hauing like abilitie in wealth, but no leſſe forward in affection to learning, ſéeking not to be ſlow or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in that, which they ſawe rayſed their common weale to benefite, and them ſelues into immortall honor, procured brotherheads to be annexed, leuied ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and particular gatheringes to erecte and endue their Colledges, and ſolicited Biſhops to tranſferre the ayde of certaine benefices, makinge by that induſtrie their colledges both faire and riche: wherein, in ſome places as the prince (to helpe the want of ſome townes vnable but well diſpoſed to plant ſuch foundacion of a common weale) hath wiſely appointed the Cathedrall and Collegiall churches to beſtow Cannon prebendes to the reliefe of Colledges, ſpecially in their capitall Townes, where ought to bee the reſidence of learned men to teach the whole Dioceſſe.

               <p>The young and couragious horſe of his owne nature fierſe and hoat, deſirous to runne if his keeper giue him the cariere, but more, if he féele the ſpurres, doth eaſely runne him ſelfe out of breath, and becomes in the ende vnprofitable: ſo frequentacion of ſtudie diſpoſed into ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hement and intemporat ſeaſons, cloſeth the young wit of a childe, wherein there is no leſſe neceſſitie of care to his maiſter, then to kéepe him from long idelnes. For that cauſe is there requiſite (as I ſayd) wiſe iudgement and diſcretion in ſcholemaiſters of youth to prouide for all things by rate and meaſure belonging to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as to gyue the ſpurres to ſuch as are ſlowe &amp; hard of witte, and to others more ready and quicke to ſtudie by liuelynes of ſpirit, to reſtrayne the bridle, fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2096:116"/> their ſharp forwardneſſe of witte and nature, and not to diſcourage them by feare and rude diſcipline: by this diſcretion and wiſe rule, they glad the ſorrowfull and entertayne them in ioye, to the ende they become not leane and lothſome, and compell ſuche as are too earneſt in ſtudie to take the recreation of a ſcholler: they muſt reſtrayne the common gamſters, and cutte ſhort their demaundes and deſires to playe, and yet in any wyſe forbeare to deale rudely with children of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall forwardneſſe and apt to receyue erudition: as of the contrary they muſt ſeuerely correct the ſtubborne by exemplarie diſcipline, leaſt they corrupt others.</p>
               <p>And ſéeing we are nowe falne vppon the recreation of wittes, it is not impertinent to make ſome preſent mention of Muſicke, as the thing that moſt of all and naturally delightes and reioyſeth the witt, wherof <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> in their politickes ſpeake at large: it is moſt ſure, that harmonie, pleaſant ſound and voice com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paſſed in meaſure, is very proper and conuenient to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the affections and troubles whereunto younge mindes are ſubiect, and to chaunge all moodes of heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and thought: for which cauſe <hi>Dauid</hi> vſed often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes the harpe and voyce: and S. <hi>Iames</hi> willeth men in their heauines to ſing Pſalmes to recomforte them: and therefore very neceſſare that the young Scholler learne to ſinge, and playe vpon muſicall inſtrumentes, ſo that it carry that intention, to ſing it as a recreation in his other ſtudies of greater importance. For then doth it beſt and moſt refreſhe the mynd and drawe the fancie from wicked thoughtes, when it is graue in it ſelfe and not corrupted with wanton ſonges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (the ſcripture is a witneſſe) how much <hi>Dauid</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued <hi>Saul</hi> &amp; qualified his bitter afflictions. But nowe eftſoones to the inſtitution of children touchinge Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: if the Maiſter finde any of ſo harde capacitie to learning, that their inclination will not bee enhabled
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2096:117"/> thereunto, let him not abuſe and leade the parentes in vnprofitable expences: but after he hath geuen them a taſte of the chriſtian Catechiſme and other principles of eternall ſaluation (which may be eaſely comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through the ſingular goodnes of God, who commes thus to communicat himſelf by doctrine to al that ſeeke to be ſaued) let them be ſent home to their parentes to applie them to the profeſſion wherein their nature takes moſt pleaſure. This is the diſcretion which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in all men profeſſing to teach and inſtruct, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which, as neither doctrine nor zeale ioined with loue to their diſciples, nor diligence, induſtrie, no nor good life it ſelfe, (much neceſſarie to the dutie of good maiſters) ſhall be able to aduaunce their Diſciples to any perfection: ſo, where all thoſe partes concurre and aſſemble in one painfull man, it is not poſſible but hée ſhall bring forth a wonderfull fruite in his eſtate: let him therefore trie out by infight &amp; diſcretion, whether his ſcholler be borne to learning, or whether he be bée-forced to it, and ſo apply his knowledge according to the abilitie of the childes wit putting to him no more at a tyme then is expedient to his capacitie: veſſelles with ſtraite neckes receyue by little and little the liquoure put into them, and others of wyder receypte refuſe not more plentifull infuſion: ſo that according to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of the veſſell, is meaſured the quantitie of liquour put into it. And as alſo men make their burdens accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the force of their body and adminiſter diet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſpoſition and hauior of the ſtomacke: euen no leſſe regarde muſt teachers haue to the qualitie of childrens wittes, not charging nor confounding them with too graue or heauy leſſons or doctrines, wherein both the tyme ſhould be vaine to the maiſter, and the labor hurtfull to the ſcholler, for that it would putte his wit in perill. And euen as it is contrary to all order to commit diuerſitie and too great aboundance of meates
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2096:117"/> to the ſtomacke hauing no power to diſgeſt them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the varietie pleaſe the appetite: euen no leſſe inconuenient and hurtful to young wittes, are the cloying leſſons, albeit they ſéeme to take pleaſure in them. But becauſe ſcholemaiſters are led to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and order of their dutie by many <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> authours, I leaue them to the ſtudie and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: not inferring theſe ſpéeches to miniſter inſtruction, but onely in paſſing, to aduertiſe them ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, that hauing ſo great a charge, they can not be too curious in the ſearch and execution of their eſtate: not forgetting the worthy example of <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> who, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king diſciples into charge, proued firſt their natures at playe, wherein a childe hides nothing of his diſpoſition, (himſelfe looking out of a grated window for not being ſéene) and cauſing to be layd in the place inſtrumentes or tooles of craftes men, bookes, knyues, ſwordes, and ſuch like things to obſerue whereunto they were moſt addicted, he iudged by this in what arte he was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them: if by long ſtudie and his paines, they chan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged not (according to the deſire of their parentes) that connaturall inclination, he aduiſed their friends to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to ſuch arte as their nature inclined them, as to the warres, to marchaundiſe, or otherwayes, ſaying (which I doe well appoue) that there is but one thinge to be chaunged, a corrupt nature, and wicked inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for touching the naturall vocation, it is neceſſarie, ſéeing it is of God, to follow it without contradiction, onles we would ſéeme to reſiſte God, becauſe that as euery member of the naturall bodye hath his proper office, ſo God hath giuen to euery man as to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his politike and myſticall body, a certain inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (or rather inſpiration) to followe ſome peculiar eſtate or arte aboue others, which S. <hi>Paule</hi> calles voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherin we muſt walke, the better to expreſſe our obedience to God.</p>

For the ſame difference that we finde betwéene light and darknes, doth <hi>Salomon</hi> ſet betwéene the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the foole or the ignorant: Chryſte calles the ignorant, blind, who if they vndertake to leade others, fall altogither in the ditch, wherein is ſignified the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of errors, whereunto do runne headlong all ſuch as haue not true ſcience. It is ſayd in the law, that for the infirmitie of this reaſon and naturall depraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, men ought not to do what ſéemed good to their iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement and mind, but muſt raiſe their regarde to that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2096:122"/> which God commaundeth, ſpecially in matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Religion: for in things naturall and ciuill there was more libertie. Then ſeeing children are corrupte, (as <hi>Quintilianus</hi> ſaith) before they can goe, being noriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in delites rather then vnderſtand them, and loue the vices which they learne in the pallaices of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, afore they haue ability to iudge of them, (ſuch is their infection euen from their firſt education and nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) thei ſtand need of rate and meaſure, and to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected euen from their cradle. We ſayed before that doctrine chaungeth the mind and makes it fructifie, for which cauſe the ſcripture compares it to the good ſéede, which as with good tylthe bringes foorth good fruite, ſo without it, the beſt groundes would rather yéelde thiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and thornes, then graine of profit: as happeneth in often experience by the beſt kinde of corne, which dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſowne but in common grounde, tournes often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes into poppel and light graine, either by the fault of the ground, the tyme, or the laborer. So there is great néede, that with the doctrine and good inſtitution of youth, there be ſuffered no corruption of manners. We ſée the grounde without tilling and ſéede bringes forth of it ſelfe naturally and without art ill hearbes &amp; wéedes, much more would our nature produce vices, and néedeth no inſtructor to doe euill: where vertues come by force of inſtruction and labor, aſwell of the maiſters as diſciples. For hauing in our ſelues but certain ſeminaries or as litle matches which we muſt kindle by force of blowing, applying matter to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the fire if we will make any.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2096:127"/> aſſured of the certain diſcipline and inſtitution of their children, and vnderſtanding from one time to another, what aduauncement they haue in their Colledge, they ſhall not loaſe their money vpon credit, and much leſſe put it to hazarde and fortune, as they ſhould if they ſent them further, where they are alſo vncertaine of their profit and ſucceſſe in learning. For being farre from them, they heare but opinions &amp; vntrue prayſes of the learning of their children, who in the meane while run foorth their time in playe and paſing the ſtreates, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (as the prouerbe is) who hath the longeſt noſe, and liue altogither as loſt children: wherein for the moſt part, they are little holpen though they bee in the charge of Maiſters. For that if they bee not learned, their ſchollers will holde no great reckoning of them, and giue leſſe héede to their councelles, leſſons, or repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. If the maiſters (not learned) haue ſpeciall tymes to goe ſtudie in ſome Vniuerſitie, what ſcope hath the ſcholler to abuſe his abſence in all inſolent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie: the maiſter occupied in his priuat ſtudies, hath neyther care nor leaſure to adminiſter teaching to hys ſcholler: for that it is to much for one bodye to beare two burdens, and one man to applie well two trades. But if he be corrupte, what example giues hee to the poore children if he be giuen to ſectes, what ſhal bee his doctrine? had it not ben better (in this deprauation) for the infortunate father to haue had no childe at all? yea, if there had bin in his Towne a ſchoole, there had bin no ſuch daungers, withall it had not coſt him ſo much, and yet the money he ſpente had remayned in the Towne, where he had ſuertie of the principall and Regents for the inſtitution of his childe, which he could not haue, ſending him farre of. I meane not heare, but when the ſcholler is in capacitie to be receyued into any Court of artes or graue doctrines, as of the Mathematikes, Phiſicke, Law, and Diuinitie, that he be ſent to more
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2096:127"/> famouſe Vniuerſities. But at the leaſt afore his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the ſchoole, let him know the partes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſition in Orations, and be reſolute in Verſes and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and ready in the partes and rules of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, wherein let all Fathers remember the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Plutarche,</hi> and not ſuffer young men alone to goe to any frée ſtudie, vntill they be ſo prepared and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in vertue, that they néede no further cenſure of their life and manners. This being not obſerued of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, bréedes many inconueniences in their youth, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially to giue libertie to children, when they haue néede of good inſtructors, for that they begin to féele the fume of fyer in their head, finde their owne ſtomacke, &amp; ryſe into wéening by their wittes and knowledge, but more by their houſes and ritches, which make them aſpire to the reputation and title of Maiſters: And (which is more to feare) they aſſubiect them ſelues to their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fleſhly deſires, wherewith they are more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited in that age, then in any other: Beſides, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall conſideration of publike profite, there bee three co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon commodities: there is firſt a great reuenue for the towne where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſchoole is, ſéeing the money and vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels which elſe ſhould be caried elſwhether, remayne there to the reliefe of many. Marchauntes ſell better their marchandiſe: Artificers haue more vente of their worke and labor: and Phiſicions, Apoticaries, &amp; ſuch neceſſary ſortes, finde more liberall vſe and gaine of their ſcience: yea, ther is no kinde of people in a town which in ſome ſorte taſteth not of the commoditie of a Colledge: laſtly, the whole youth of a Towne findes by the preſence of a ſchoole, a helpe to learninge, and a readie way to good manners, and ſo by ſuch inſtitution and diſcipline they are prepared to vertue: wherin this ought to be a ſpecial care to Gouernours, that after the erection of their ſchoole, there bee not ſo poore a younge childe in the towne, which is not conſtrayned to goe to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2096:128"/> the ſchoole to learne the principles of fayth &amp; command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God: ſo prouiding that the poore maye bee taught by almes till they haue age to trauell, or if their inclination draw them to learning, let there be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by the contribution of the beſt. And being riſen to abilitie in learning to take in charge children of good houſes: it is the beſt acte of charitie to preferre them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, not the leaſt conuenient for ſuche charge by their diligence which neceſſarily they muſte vſe aboue others in conſideration of their pouertie and hope of aduauncement: and ſo from the eſtate of maiſters in priuat houſes they may in tyme become ſeruiceable to their common weale: which is all in effect I will ſaye now touching the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities and benefites growinge by ſchooles, wherein young wittes, doe as it were, but playe their prize to a greater excellencie. For if they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to profit, ritches, eternall pleaſures, honoures, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, to know God, and ſéeke their ſaluation, let them haue learning, as the principall meane to leade them thereunto. And if men ſuffer ſo many cares, and toiles of body and minde to compaſſe thoſe benefites, muche more ought we to ſuffer to reache to this liberall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine by the which are to bee obtayned the infinite and perpetuall felicities? if doctrine be the nurſe of vertue and honor, if we loue vertue and honor, ought wée not with the ſame affection to ſéeke and followe the meane by the which we aſpire thereunto? It is not poſſible to haue true honor without vertue: for whiche cauſe the <hi>Romaines</hi> erected two temples ioyned togither, the one dedicated to vertue, and the other to honour: but none could enter into the temple of honor, but he muſt firſt paſſe thorough the ſacred houſe of vertue. Honor and glorie follow the man of vertue, as the ſhadow doth his body: but if the ignorant or man of vices purſue honor, it fléeeth from him as from his aduerſarie, and can hold no conuerſation with him.</p>

But being aſked why he caried not away the goods of the towne, as golde, ſiluer, and other precious mouables, he aunſwered, I carie all my goods with me, meaning that ſcience and vertue were his goods. What honour had <hi>Plato</hi> by his learning when it wrought him grace euen with the greateſt tirants, who, contrary to their condicion, thought him worthy of high reuerence: yea the enemies of <hi>Athens,</hi> taking him vppon the ſea gaue ſuch honour to his ſcience and vertue, that they ſaued his life, notwithſtanding they were ſworne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of all the <hi>Athenians</hi> falling into their handes: if hée had deſired riches, he might haue excéeded all the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie men of his time, and ſo might alſo all the other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, the ſame being expreſſed by <hi>Thales Meliſien,</hi> who, beeing reproched of his pouertie &amp; called begger, made ſuch prouidence for wealth by his excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that in ſhort time he caried no occaſions to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led poore: wherewith when he had choked the ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, he declared immediatly the baſe eſtimation hée made of worldly goods departing all his treaſure amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Many are the benefites in a common weale growing by well experienced gouernours, wiſe in polletike Phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loſophie, and learned in the lawes, but much more by the deuines: Yea learned men béeing vertuous and honeſt, do in the world the ſame which the ſoule doth in the body, without whoſe action ſubſiſting, the bodye would fall dead, and become a carcaſe of earth: yea that

For as the lawes diuine and humaine are (as it were) the ſtrength and walles of common weales, euen ſo are the ſtatutes of a Colledge, the fortreſſe and bulwarke of the ſame, without the which it can not bée long kept from diſorder and vtter ruine. Let the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors and Citizens honour their Colledge with often viſitacion and contemplation of the principall and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentes, to whom for their learning ſake belonges that merit of honor, but ſpecially if they be come farre off to doe ſeruice to their Citie, leauing their proper Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis and priuat commodities. By this viſitacion it will come to paſſe that the principall and Regents ſhall be better obeyed and feared of their ſchollers, and they which
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2096:133"/> with their tutors, and altogyther better moued with common readineſſe to doe the duetie of their Colledge: and in caſes of wrong, iniurie, and vexation offered by any, let them ioyne with them in ayde and councell to aduaunce exemplarie iuſtice: wherein, in applying fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor and protection to thoſe that repreſent them all, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Magiſtrates as general parentes of a whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince in the inſtitution of their youth (to whom then if iniurie be offered, the Magiſtrate and whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale haue intereſt therein, and therefore with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affection ought to purſue the offender to publike iuſtice) they doe honor to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales in thoſe learned men, who, reſorting to Vniuerſities, or other publike or priuat places, will giue honorable opinion &amp; rapport touching the pollicie and order of that Citie.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, there can not be to great honor, reuerence, and affection borne to thoſe perſones, by whoſe indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie in the inſtitution and education of youth, ſo many benefites grow, as by them, whole common weales be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come happie: ſo that if men loue and honor vertue, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, honor, dignities, ritches, reſte, and publike felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, much more ought they to honor and cheriſhe thoſe men by whom all thoſe benefites are brought to whole countreys? If Fathers and mothers beare ſo deare loue to their children, with deſire to ſée them riſe into manners and qualities of ciuill men? ought they not with great affection to embrace and cheriſhe ſuche, by whom in their places, and with no leſſe Fatherly zeale their children are inſtructed, taught, corrected, and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euen to their deſires yea, if their Diſciples were their proper children by kind and bloud, they could vſe no more affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make them learned and vertuouſe. In déed ſuche deſerue not the name of maiſters, who, bearing no frank care and loue to their ſchollers, ſéeme as marcenary men, and but to regarde the preſent gayne, holding their Schollers in negligence, and their

               <p>Touching the principal, he ought to loue his regents as his bretherne, who as he is the auncient and firſt in authoritie ouer them, ſo, by the ſcripture, to the eldeſt is aſcribed the preheminence and ſupreame rule in a familie: and acknowledging him ſelfe as a brother, in the aduauncement and protection of his bretherne, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them aide and fauour to his vttermoſt power and credit: in an other conſideration he is called the head of the regents and ſchollers: (the regents being the chiefe and principall members of the body vnder the head, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſchollers the inferior:) So that as he being a brother muſt behaue himſelfe to his brothers in brotherly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and as the head, gouerne his moſt principall and excellent members with a chiefeſt care and dutie, and ſo ſée the reſt beare mutuall amitie one to another. In like ſort ought the Regents to acknowledge all loue, feare, and franke obedience (as they are warned by the law of God) to their eldeſt and moſt auncient brother, forbearing (as neare as they can) to grieue their head or giue him any occaſion of offence, the ſame being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together againſt the law of nature, God, and man: as in a naturall bodie, by how much the members are neare to the head, by ſo much doo they trauell to giue aide and pleaſure to their naturall head, as retayning of it more prouidence or influxion: euen ſo ſchollers (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all law and reaſon) ought to beare, loue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, feare, and obedience in all ſubiection, to their head and principall firſt, and next to their Regents: yea the ſame loue, honour, feare, and obedience, which they owe to their parents, and duties to the Magiſtrates, ought they to performe ſubſtancially to their principall and Regents being as Lieftenants to their Fathers, Mothers, and Magiſtrate, and whom the Principall &amp; Regents loue with the affection of Fathers, no leſſe then if they were their proper children: For recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,

In which reſpects as they well deſerue to be loued and honoured as their Maſters: ſo, yet they are bound to it moſt of all, when they are riſen into knowledge, by which they receiue the honorable fruit of their ſtudies how often ſo euer they ſée themſelues honored for their learning, how often they gaine by it, when they take moſt pleaſure in their Science, and ſée themſelues rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into dignitie and felicitie aboue others bycauſe of their learning and vertue: euen ſo often let them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the remembrance of their Maſters, and embrace them with perfect loue, as who were their originall &amp; happy meanes to raiſe them to thoſe eſtates, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom, they had ben contemnible to the world with out any honorable ornament of nature, forbearinge the rudenes of ſome vnthankfull diſciples, who being once highly mounted, make no more reckoning of the ſtirop that raiſed them to their high ſeat: wherin much leſſe that they deſerue that they haue, but with vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full children not acknowledging to their parents their due honour nor the aide and dutie which they owe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are not worthy of common life.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:2096:135"/> to thoſe ſeates of honour: when we ſée a goodly building ſo excellent in beautie that the worlde giues it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler eſtimation, what can we aſcribe leſſe to him who laied the foundation and raiſed the worke to that excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lencie then the principall praiſe? For if faire, delitefull and profitable workes be ſo generally prayſed, nothing leſſe is due to the hand that faſhioned them: Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites to behold a goodly picture, doth great wrong to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> painter, if he aſcribe not much to the commendation of his ſkill: yea, if there were layd on but the firſt cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, yet the beholder ought to be thankfull to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie and labour. But if ſuch as nouriſh our mortall bodies deſerue great affection &amp; memorable renoume, much more are we bound both in loue and perpetuall dutie, to them that miniſter foode to the immortall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of little children: if ſo great reuerence be reſerued to Phiſitions, for helping the health of bodies, which one day muſt die notwithſtanding: Is there not more merit of honour to ſuch as cure our ſoules of immortal diſeaſes? The ſcripture pronounceth many textes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhame of thoſe which deſpiſe ſcholemaſters: of which profeſſion Chriſt ſéemed to make his Apoſtles when he ſpake to <hi>Peter:</hi> if thou loueſt mée féede my Lambes.

I ſaye not that vnder that name are ment all ſortes of people, and yet it can not be denied but that thoſe littleones deſerue chief inſtruction: For <hi>S.

If a Father ſhew more deare loue to his little children, then to thoſe that haue riper age, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it not by congruent reaſon, that ſuch as giue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>coures to thoſe little ones and kéepe them from daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, deſerue better recompence of the Father, then if they had done ſeruice to his greater ſonnes? If the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle plant in the garden of any Farmer, be ſo much che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed that the eye of the owner is ſeldome from it: hée then that watreth it, prunes it, and defends it from the cropping of beaſtes, and other iniuries, what ſeruice doth he to the owner? Yea what greater pleaſure can he do to the Farmer: whoſe young plant without this induſtrie, were ſubiect to ſpoyle, without hope to yéeld any fruite: euen as if the little Lambes of the flocke were loſt, and the young children corrupt, there were no exſpectation of reſtitution of that loſſe and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on. The ſchoolemaſter then, hauing in charge theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lambes of Ieſus Chriſt, and the preparing of this tender plant of his gardeine (which is the Church) and laſtly the leading of theſe little children, being the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites of the Lord, how acceptable is his loyall and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſeruice to his Lorde, and to God? And if ſuch as ſclaunder theſe little ones through wicked doctrine &amp; example, deſerue to haue faſtened to their necke a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and drowned in the bottome of the déepeſt Sea: What recompence or reward is due to thoſe tutors &amp; ſcholemaſters by whome thoſe littleones are inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and led in example of all holines? Are they not wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy as <hi>Daniell</hi> ſayeth, to ſhine as the firmament and ſtarres of heauen in euerlaſting glory, and to be called the greateſt of the kyngdome of God? Yea (according to Ieſus Chriſt) euen the moſt happie of all? And if eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2096:136"/> one ought to receiue the reward of his trauels, as there is no eſtate of more hard laboures, more great paines, more perpetuall perplexeties, and more often reproches, yea being euen as little martyrs: ſo there is no profeſſion wherein are leſſe faultes: For the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſéeking but to comunicate their learning with their diſciplrs, neuer endure their vices: if they ſpeake euill, they correct them: if they do euill they are puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: they neuer giue them libertie of idlenes though they allow times of neceſſary recreation. In this eſtate is nothing but chaſtitie, for which cauſe they are called <hi>Pallas,</hi> and the Muſes being Mayds, by which occaſion, not without cauſe the Poets fained <hi>Pallas</hi> the Goddes of wiſedome and mayde with hir nine mayden ſiſters the Muſes, who alſo as they ſignifie the exerciſe of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, contayning in it virginitie and perpetuall hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: ſo they are called ſiſters, as being all of one mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſocietie, and indiuidible coniunction. There is no thing but vertue, and godlines in a ſchoole, and therfore it deſerues well to be called a religion: if in any bookes of the pagans, there be wordes vnciuill, bearing to vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chaſt loue, or expreſſing nombers of Goddes: the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are aduertiſed by their tutors, that they are ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of infidelles which knew not God, and therfore in taking the roſe, they may leaue the thornes, and being taught the good, they are alſo warned from that which is euill. What reſteth now more to be alleadged of theſe detractors and ſcoffers of the eſtate of ſchoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſo noble and happie, and almoſt the generall cauſe of all the benefites that are done in the worlde: where they being men of vaine and light ſpirites, are alſo a people vnprofitable, and a burden and charge to the earth, Rattes and deuowring vermin of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of good men, bycauſe they haue not paſſed by good ſchooles, where, (with ciuilitie in ſpéech and life) they might haue learned ſome Art, profitable to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,

Theſe ſcoffers by contempt call ſchoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>Magisters</hi> and <hi>Dominos,</hi> which turnes as a glory to them, for that they haue thoſe names common with Ieſus Chriſt ſaying to his Diſciples, you call me <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister</hi> and <hi>Domine, ſum etenim</hi> ſo ſchoolemaſters are <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gistri,</hi> by the ſtate of their teaching, and <hi>Domini,</hi> for that they commaund their diſciples, and giue lawes to their affections and luſtes: where thoſe diſpiſers of good men (for whom according to <hi>Salomon</hi> the terrible iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments of God are prepared) are thralles and ſlaues to their paſſions:<note place="margin">Pro. 19.</note> yea, it is to be feared, that they are euen the bondmen of Sathan, whom they obey, and are the executors of his commaundements, whereof the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt pernicious, is, to contemne the good ſort and vex with violence and wrong, men of learning and vertue, being an eſtate that moſt batter the kingdome of Sathan, &amp; bring ruine to his tirannie.

In this ſorte then, both the one and the other young wittes aſwell ſharpe and forwarde, as ſlowe and dull, are exhorted to gette knowledge, for the which (togither with actes of true vertue) they are truely acknowledged worthie of the name of men, as without them, they are but creatures maſked, rather then men: neither worthy of worldly honor, nor reſolued of the certaine meane to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and much leſſe able to comprehende what God is: knowledge will enable them and ſet them oute to what eſtate they like to follow, and bring them honor, though they will not make exerciſe of learning. And beſides the pleaſure, they ſhall receyue by it ſwéet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, and aſſured honor: yea be it that they profeſſe eſtate of armes (a lyfe ſéeming farre eſtraunged from lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) euen there alſo doctrine giues the greateſt ayde, according to the fame of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Captaines, who, being learned men, brought foorth actes more valiant and wonderful then others: and by learning, the great <hi>Alexander, Caeſar,</hi> &amp; <hi>Augustus</hi> (amongeſt other princes moſt learned) haue brought no ſmall renowne to their enterpriſes and actes of warre. For this cauſe the poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes haue fayned <hi>Pallas</hi> (ſignifying ſcience) armed, and as a leader of a campe: meaning by that fiction that an armie is moſt ſuerly guyded by Captaines learned, as in whom reſteth moſt ſuttle and ſharp ſpirites, and a ſettled iudgement of all the pollicies and ſtrategemes of other auncient Captaines conquering townes, cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Touching the Huſband, he ought to acknowledge him ſelfe to be created of God (and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with action of thanks) man, to his image and likenes, to the ende to repreſent him heare in all perfection of vnderſtanding, of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of reaſon. And albeit he hath erred (I meane in <hi>Adam</hi>) and is falne by ſinne from that ſimilitude &amp; Image of perfection: yet he hath alwayes reteyned (by

So that by how much he hath that aduantage aboue the wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man in thoſe naturall vertues, by ſo much more is hée bound to expreſſe and ſhow them in the gouernement of his wife and houſholde: And therefore it is méete hée kéepe in ſocietie with his quicke and ſharp vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, a déepe iudgement, and a reaſon exempt and frée from all vaine and wicked affections, which he ſhall then performe to his honor, and prayſe of his kynd, and preheminence of nature, when he ſhall moſt decke and ſet out his minde with knowledge (ſpecially of GOD) which is as a light to the minde in all her ſpeculations and humane actions: and when hee ſhal bee garniſhed with faith, and reſkued by the ayde of Gods grace, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and communicated to the humble &amp; good liuers: And ſo a man taking this courſe, with common and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent exerciſe in vertue, may marrie in a competent &amp; reaſonable age, which is, in ſome ſooner, and in others more late, according to the importance of their nature and ſtrength: At the furtheſt, let him not excéede xxxvi. yeres, a tyme for marriage preſcribed by <hi>Heſiode</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi> I thinke they ſpake chiefly of Philoſophers, and ſuch, to whom, by the perpetuall exerciſe of their youth, was no oportunitie or leaſure to marie) nor ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then at xx. yeares (if there be no iuſt cauſes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation) as not to reſtraine the vigor and naturall faculties of ſtrength and growing, which continues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The ſame is alſo a lawfull cauſe to ſtaie maides
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2096:141"/> from haſtie marriage, ſpecially afore they beare ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and iuſt ſtature, and their naturall forces reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: other wayes they ſtand in perill of the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with their huſbandes, whiche afterwardes can not be remedied. I know the poſitiue lawes aduaunce the time of mariage, giuing libertie to the man at xiiii. and the mayd at xii. yeares: not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe lawes approue that prerogatiue, or anticipate marriage by commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but onely by permiſſion, to prouide for and bridle thoſe intemperat luſtes, which eaſely can not bée limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in young men left to idle libertie, and without the authoritie of parentes: by which occaſion without this meane, their hoat youth would carrie them into adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, inceſtes, and rapes, with other filthie delites of the fleſhe, wherein they would wallow as little pigges in puddles. This councell I giue by the opinion and conſent of naturall philoſophie, according to the which, wiſe men are wont to gouerne their bodies, and kéepe their youth from corruption. And in the Scripture we read y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grown to perfect ſtature, as <hi>Jſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> had xl. yeares afore they married: a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were able to enter wedlocke by holy and wyſe iudgement, not to accompliſhe onely the pleaſures of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh (vnworthie for ſuch as know God) but of purpoſe chiefly to raiſe procreation (according to the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of marriage) whom they had then diſcretion to inſtruct in the knowledge and feare of God wherunto they are enioyned by ſcripture:<note place="margin">Phil. 5.</note> leauing the other cauſe (whiche is the remedie of infirmitie) for ſuche as vexed with hoat luſte ſtood in daunger to ſlyde into the corrupte ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes of the fleſhe.</p>
               <p>The youth of <hi>Jſrael</hi> were neuer admitted to mariage, till they bare age to be enrolled in the bookes of muſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the warrs, the better to be able to defende their wyfe and children againſt enemies: wherin the fact can not but beare againſt all reaſon to committ
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2096:142"/> a wife to a huſband, in whom is neyther force to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend hir, nor diſcretion to direct hir (both which are moſt neceſſary in mariage) and much leſſe being pore him ſelfe, hath no mean by art or abylitie of induſtrye to prouide for his wife and howſhold: great ſuer is the folly in ani man to aſpire to mariage afore he haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the vertues requiſit to the honorable direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that eſtat, and by diſcretion can employe his we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth gotten to vſes, and be able by law and force (if need be) to defend him and his againſt all violent oppreſſors But much more intolerable is that raſhnes that leads men to marie being not yet prepared to entertain and prouide for the neceſſities of it: by this the ſéede of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie is ſowen in all parts of a kingdome, wherof the harueſt is more ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifull then of other things: their children haue their ſuccoure in begging, &amp; their wiues yet young, are conſtrayned with diſhonour to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the great perill of their chaſtitie: In the mean while, till nature eſtabliſh compotent years, let this forward youth be tamed by trauells and continuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, let them be enured with ſermons and doctrine, by the which they may reſtraine their paſſions: but ſpecially on feſtiuall days, a time when idlenes ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with libertie, invites youth both to do and think euill, yea if ther be any feaſon reſerue of the hollydays from their ſpirituall duties, let it be performed in ſome playes or exerciſe of paine and trauell, by the which both the mind ſhall be diſcontinued from idle thoughtes, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodye taken out of the care of beaſtly deſiers: But ſeing the intent of mariage, is the hope of procreation, ſuch as ar colde of nature, defectiue, and impotent ought not to marrie: yea if they be married by faulſe perſwaſion, the mariage may be diſſolued: Such alſo as be vnclean and diſeaſed, ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedle mariage, as well for the reſpect of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, to the which their children ſhould not

Yea their whole howſe borne to this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, not to on ſuffered good day in all their life with out ſorowe, and ſighing,<note place="margin">Gen. 8.</note> and bear (as it weare) a death vppon their backes euen from their firſt birth: In this the woman diſpoſed to marie ought as well as the man not to make fielthy luſte the principall end of hir marriage, (for that were to enter wedding with infidells) and an intention reproued in the ſcriptures, as in <hi>Tobyas</hi> it is ſayd that a deuill caulled <hi>Aſmodeas,</hi> killed ſeuen huſbandes of <hi>Sara</hi> the firſt night of their marriges, who for the only luſt of the fleaſh, and deſier of hir beautie, had maried her one after another. So did the children of god marie afore the floud (I mean the ſonnes of <hi>Seth</hi> which had learned to ſerue God) who ſeing the daughters of men (that is deſcended of the race of <hi>Cain</hi>) worldly, faier, and brauely attired, maried with them: For which carnall affection (for they torned afterwardes from the feare of God) the Lord roaſe in to ſuch ire, togteher alſo for other vices of that world, that he ſent a generall ſlud: And Ieſus Chriſt giues to vnderſtand, that that luſt &amp; diſordred pleaſure, are the cauſes that maried folkes, called to the ſpirituall banquet of God, make no rekconing of of it, excuſing themſelues by the hinderance their mariadges, which ought rather to bee aydes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meanes for the man and woman to animat one an other to ſearch God, in whoſe name they are aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to pray, to proſper them in their mariadge, &amp; giue
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2096:143"/> them children, whom they may inſtruct in his law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that they are mortall, and if they offend God and liue not in him, he can and will punniſh them with ſome miſerie: I ſay not but beautie is requiſite in mariage, as wee read <hi>Jacob</hi> was more deſirous to haue <hi>Rachell</hi> to wife, becauſe ſhe was fairer then <hi>Lia:</hi> And albeit in many places, wiues are prayſed in the Scripture for their beautie (which is a gift of God in nature) yet, it is with this leſſon, that men take héede, that it be not the only cauſe aſſociated with luſt, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the minde to mariage. For ſuch ſocieties of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke as they, are not of the Iſraelites and Chriſtians who haue commaundements to renounce the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and luſtes, and to put on a new man: So, they can not but ſtand in daunger to be prophaned by ſuch affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as not diffring much from thoſe fleſhly mariages, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which partly the generall flood was ſent to drown the creatures of the earth. Touching wealth or riches for the which many do marry, and in that onely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, not marying wiues, but their wealth, many enter wedlocke with their Miſtreſſes, and chuſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wiues whom they know to be barreine, old, and counterfet: In whom hauing no hope of procreation, what other thing doo ſuch huſbands but abuſe mariage through couetouſnes, &amp; prophane it, no leſſe then others by vnbrideled and whoriſh luſtes: The poore ought to be maried with the riche, according to the cuſtome of the <hi>Lacedemonians:</hi> And in the Scripture we find that men bought their wiues as <hi>Jacob</hi> redéemed his, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as it is a great reproch to a man to take charge of a wife, if he haue not abilitie and meane to mayntaine hir: So in ſuch ſocieties, (I meane by vnlawful means in perſons vnlike in qualitie, and contrary in manners and nature,) it happneth, that ſeldome is found true friendſhip betwene man and wife, but diſſembled loue, perpetual diſſention, ieloſies, and diſſolute whoredoms,

This man bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus married, ought firſt with the conſideration of his perfection of nature and common graces of GOD which he hath more then the woman, to employe them all chiefly to the inſtruction, guyde and gouernement of his wyfe, and then to the direction of his affaires: he is bound to communicate ſuch lawes as he would haue his wyfe to kéepe, with louing inſtruction, exhortinge her to the partes of her dutie friendly, without anye force, proteſting alſo to performe what belonges to his office, being both bound thereunto by the expreſſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of God.

The head hath the eye to ſée, the eare to heare, the tong to ſpeake and taſte, and all to the profit and benefit of the whole bodye, taking perpetuall care of it, &amp; féeling the gréeues of euery member as his own: euen the like doth Ieſus Chriſt for his Church ſpiritually, ſéeing and foreſéeing what ſo euer is neceſſary for it: he heareth her plaintes and neceſſities, and gyues her ſuccour with perpetuall ayde: what then ought the man to doe to his wife? to what care and prouidence is he bound ouer her? yea to what rate of ayde and ſuccour is he tyed, if he will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely expreſſe the example of his patron? if he do it not, what greater wrong can he offer to God, or manifeſt iniurie to the holy inſtitution of mariage? makes hée not ſolemne profeſſion to follow that diuine Spouſe of the Church by his mariage, as alſo the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proteſtes for her parte to follow the church? Beſides, as the head naturally loues the body, as vnited with it by nature in indiuiſible vnitie, he workes for it, he takes thought for it, and defendes it: ſo Ieſus Chriſt conioyned to his church, loueth it dearely, watcheth for it, kepes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectes it againſt the aſſaultes of all viſible and inuiſible enemies. What belonges then to the huſbande, the image of this ſpirituall ſpouſe of Ieſus Chriſt, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déemed his church with his bloud when ſhée was thrall to ſathan: waſhed her with his proper bloud when ſhée was vncleane: dyed to reuiue her being dead: iuſtifieth her and bliſſeth her afterwardes in communicatinge to her parte of all his benefits, and making her with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe coinheritor of his Paradiſe. Could hée ſhowe her more great ſignes of perfect amitie? yea hee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned himſelfe with her as one fleſh, making hir fleſh of his fleſhe, bloud of his bloud, and bones of his bones:

For that cauſe <hi>S. Peter</hi> calleth the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man coinheritrix of grace and life with the man, and (with <hi>S.

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:2096:178"/> of place for that only neceſſitie of order tied me thereun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to, which I haue obſerued in the diſcourſe of Apothica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Chirurgions following the Phiſitions, where I ſhould haue placed them after the aduocates, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of qualetie. But as in this obſeruation is no diſhonour to the marchaunt, ſo, hee ſhall find no leſſe inſtruction touching the office of his calling according to God, then if his diſcourſe had come afore the reſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer many of whom I muſt confeſſe hee hath right of preheminence by common cuſtome of nations and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Marchant then aboue al thinges (in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of common traffike betweene men) is to conſider déepely of the two generall lawes, <hi>Thou ſhalt not doo to another that which thou wouldest not haue done to thy ſelfe: and loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> And as they vſe the yard to meaſure their wares, and the ballance to waigh it: and that there is no cloth nor other wares meaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which they do not paſſe by the yard or elne, nor any thing méete to be waighed, which they caſt not into the ballance, vſing both the one and the other aſwell in vile and baſe, as riche and precious thinges, applying alſo the helpe of nombers for the better diuiſion of perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities if néede requireth: So, in all traffikes, whither in groſſe or in retaile, the marchant is bound to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of thoſe two commaundements, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he is expreſſely enioyned, that as he would not him ſelf be deceiued, ſo alſo he muſt not willingly adminiſter de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceite or wrong to an other, neyther beare ſuch loue to his proper profite, as in it maye be bred the iniurie or harme of another: but in all things of commutation &amp; bargaine, to vſe the ſame conuerſation to ſtraungers, which he would others ſhould vſe to him: Who, in their common actions, would rightly applie this lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grounded on true reaſon, and the other of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell deriued of charitie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfect fulfilling of all lawes, much leſſe that they ſhould néede inſtructions, ſéeinge
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:2096:178"/> they ſhould ſeldome finde occaſions to erre. And the cauſe why there remaine at theſe dayes ſo manye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, conſtitutions, and ſtatutes, is in no other reſpect but that men eyther could not or would not rule their actions by thoſe two lawes, and much leſſe applie them from generalitie, into ſpeciall particulars. I would to God, that euen as the Marchant of cloth vſeth his elne or yarde not to beguile him ſelfe or his chapman in the meaſure, that alſo and aſwell, he would vſe the lawe of nature and charitie, in the price &amp; goodnes of his cloth, euen ſuch as he would the other ſhould ſell to him, if there were exchaunge of qualitie: if he would haue the price reaſonable full meaſure, not to be paſſed by the ſhort yarde, which ought to be ſolde by the longe, and that the cloth be good, ſubſtantiall and ſufficient, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupted in the making, nor burnt in the dying.</p>
               <p>Let him euen do the like to his chapman, comming to buy of him: where then ſhal be the common ſayinge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, <hi>Let the marchant ſell his wares as well as he can,</hi> it is lawfull to euery one to make his beſt profit: No man is bound to ſell ſo iuſtely: and that the lawe bindes to no reſtitution, though the wares bée ſolde at double priſe: all theſe ſpéeches, and the effectes that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe of them, are of the very inuencion of Pagans, &amp; wretchedly vpholden and entertayned by pagan chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whoſe eyes of vnderſtandinge, couetouſnes hath cloſed vp, and reſtrained them from the cleare light of reaſon, infuſed into vs from heauen euen by IESVS Chriſt the ſelf light: But all men what ſo euer, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing theſe two lawes of conſcience ready to ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in contracting, bargayning, ſelling, buying, choppinge, chaunging, and in the traffike of euery particular mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe: I ſaye, if he doe not all in conſcience, as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to doe to a brother, and one friende to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, abandoning deceyte in euery dealing (for in caſe of deſire to gayne by deceite, bloud, and brotherhoode, &amp;

But here the Marchantes alleadge, that it is ſo with all the worlde, and if they ſhould goe ſo ſtricktly and iuſtly to work, the principall and neceſſarie charges would not be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Little doe they remember in this, that it is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to conforme our dooings with the worlde,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.

Let vs rather eſtéeme this worlde wretched, as to the which Ieſus Chriſt would not once vouchſafe to imparte one onely prayer, but hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied vpon it malediction, in reſpect of the miſeries: who followeth then the guide of this diring, curſed and blind world, is it not directly to ſuffer him ſelfe to bée ledde into the bottomes of hell? Touching the other point that <hi>by ſelling iustly is no great gaine,</hi> let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the perſuaſion of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that a little is better with the feare of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 36.</note> then all the ritches of ſinners: what doth it profit to gayne a whole world for certain daies, and looſe a paradiſe for euer? Oh you Marchantes of little faith, fearing to féele neceſſitie if you liue in the ſtate of honeſt men, beholde the man following his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the feare of God, and liuing accordinge to his lawes, is aſſured by the word of GOD not to fall into want, but that God will ayde him and giue bleſſing to his labours: where, of the contrary it hapneth that the deceyuer is beguyled,<note place="margin">Eſay. 33.</note> and who doth wrong to an other findes recompenſe of wrong, and what he feareth, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth often tymes vnto him:<note place="margin">Pro 10.</note> yea, albeit God ſuffer him to become ritch by vnrighteouſe meanes, his wealth taryeth euen no longer, then we ſée a landflud fallings
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:2096:179"/> in great aboundaunce, and preſently paſſeth away, and the place become drie. And as we ſee in dayly experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that the ſecond or third heires of ſuche marchantes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly enriched, ſell their houſes, ſhoppes, liuinges, and become bankerout, leauing no other remembrance then that which a foule ſmoak leaues to a new whited wall. So the ſmall ſtocke of a good and vpright mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant takes his encreaſe by little and litle, as the corne and graſſe multiplieth into plentie: yea, his ſucceſſion becomes an infinit generation. There bée marchantes of honeſt pollicie, but of couetous intencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who, ſelling at reaſonable rate, do often times gayne more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for, ſetting reaſonable prices of their wares, they draw more buyers, and by conſequence, more vſe of money: whereby it happeneth, that gayning but a groate in a yarde, hée findes his encreaſe more in the yeares end, then an other that (with a ſlow vent) gaines a teſtor in euerie yarde: who, to auoyde the hazarde of his wares by long kéeping, and becauſe he would rayſe a great gaine, ſelles his wares of credit to chapmen in the countrey, but at his owne price, ſome tymes double or treble aboue their proper worth: thus ſelleth he time which is none of his, and beguiles ſimple people, who, eyther not knowing the value of his wares, or at leaſt conſtrayned to take them by neceſſitie: whereby, the marchant, bound by Gods lawe, to reléeue and fauour the neceſſities of the néedie, leaues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not in this, but committes them to raunſome, and afterwardes when payment comes, layeth them vpon the racke, diſtrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their corne, their harueſt, and for a ſmall matter, leades away the ſubſtance that ſhould nouriſhe them &amp; their poore families all the yeare. There be alſo that vſe a worſe trade, encreaſing their money by monthly loane which they call honeſt intereſt: but becauſe aſwel monthly vſurie as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lewd dealings of many marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; their broakers (being as the deuil &amp; his diſciples) are

And béeing there I had quicke vent of my wares with reaſonable gaine, and with the money bought (ſomewhat aboue the market) ſo much corne as my proporcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would ſtretch vnto.

                  <note place="margin">Jam. 2.</note> charging them in the crime of acception of perſones with vnrighteous doing wrong to God, and to the pore: for God ſayeth he, eſtemes aſmuche the iuſte pore man as the riche, yea he ſéemes to beare more fauour to the pore, adopting them the heirs of his Kingdome, which he giueth to ſuch as loue him: <hi>Saint James</hi> alſo rebukes the honor that is giuen to richemen in great aſſemblies for the only reſpect and name of their wealth (a kinde of Idolatrie to honor a creature, vile, and inſenſible in a man, as is riches) and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the pore, by reaſon of his pouertie, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:2096:188"/> is moſt acceptable and honorable with God, as being innocent and without hurt: where in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riche man (according to the Apoſtle) is founde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny actes of oppreſſions, which haue fauour of impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, albeit they deſerue extreame iudgement: To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe alſo the pore man, is double ſinne, as both retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in iniurie againſt God, who hath made the pore aſwell as the riche, yea, honoreth him with his more ſinguler graces as apeared euen ſince the time of the lawe, chuſing for his prophetts men extremelye pore: as alſo againſte the pore man himſelfe, who with his preſent pouertie feeles yet an other affliction, when he findes him ſelfe diſpiſed. Secondly, riche men ought to be perſwaded by faith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their welth comes not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their labors, their witts, nor prouidences: for (ſayeth <hi>Salomon</hi>) the bleſſing of God makes men riche, and keepes them from ſuffering affliction: it is of mear grace that God makes ſome to proſper in the goodes and affairs of the worlde with out ſuffering loſſe or vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? And as ther be many that trauell no leſſe then they, yea with equall induſtrye, prouidence, and care and yet are vnder the yoke of pouertie: So then let riche men attribute nothing to them ſelues, but all to the bountifull prouidence of God, by the mean of ſome little labor which they take, as if they would attribut the fertilytie of a good ground yelding for one graine aboundance of corne, being but ſimply tilled to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident ordenance of God, and not to their induſtrie &amp; manuring, ſeeing there is no ground, which though it be tilled and fatted with great labour, and ſowen with neuer ſo good ſéedes, will yet yéeld no fruite neither in plentie nor price, becauſe the bleſſing of God hath not bene giuen to that ground to make it riche in corne: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo the poore are ordayned of God to their eſtate of pouertie, I meane the good ſort, for ſuch as by neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, by whoredome, or other vnthriftines, become poore, are
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:2096:188"/> cauſes of their owne decaye: as there be, that contrary to the ordena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God get riches by vſeries and other vnlawfull meanes, deſeruing not to bée called the rich men of God, but of Sathan: as alſo ſuch as by miſgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement become poore, are not called by the poore of God: and as ſuch are not true poore falling into pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by their owne vices, and not poore by God but by his permiſſion, ſo alſo riche men are rauinors by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring power of God, and not by his will.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, rich me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith may apprehend Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, bearing them fauour and frendſhip to eſtabliſh them in proſperitie &amp; eaſe aboue their other bretherne, (as belonging all to one heauenly Father, drawne out of one mother which is nature, and qualified of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon elementes touching the conſtitution of the body) whom they ſée ſubiect to more pouertie and affliction: for the which as they are bound to a more action of thankes to God, ſo let them ſearch the cauſe why he reſerueth ſuch fauour for them: and why alſo and for what ende there bée ſo many poore, euen to the ende of the world, which can neuer attaine to ritches, on whom (if it had ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him) he might by the opening of his plentiful hand, haue beſtowed great ritches, as he did vppon <hi>Job</hi> after his extréeme pouertie: In conſideration of all which cauſes, it will fall out neceſſarie with our purpoſe, to preſcribe aſwell to the ritch as the poore, their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar dutie according to God. Firſt then the riche ought not to ſwell or preſume by any opinion of his ritches, nor the poore fall into infirmitie of hart by reaſon of his pouertie, and much leſſe eſtéeme him ſelfe of inferiour grace with God, or eſtimacion amongeſt men, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to one ſelf iudgement of reaſon: but (with Saint <hi>James</hi>) let him take occaſion to glorifie him ſelfe in God of his poore and abiect condition, in hope to be exalted: as of the contrary, the ritch arrogant man hath to feare to be throwne downe after this life, the ſame being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:2096:189"/> in the example of the wicked riche man, caſt by wicked ſpirites into extréeme neceſſitie and horrible tormentes of hel, where the ſoule of poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> was caried by Angelles into the boſom of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The promiſe of Gods kingdome is made onely to the poore, and therefore if the riche wil be ſaued, let them buy it of the poore by true faith and charitie, and almes, with deedes of compaſſion. You rich men (ſaith Ieſus Chriſt) make you friendes of the Mammon of iniquitie,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. Luc. 16.</note> that is, of the richeſſe which induce men to much euill, draw mindes to vnlawfull luſtes, torment hartes with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked cares, make their owners idolators, being vniuſtly gotten, are alſo carefully kept, and by their abuſes, are the cauſes to infinit people of euerlaſting damnacion.</p>
               <p>In this alſo the rich ſort ought to feare, for that GOD giues riches to many as their porcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which they haue to looke for from him, according to the ſaying of <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> to the riche man in the Goſpell: <hi>My ſonne, thou hast al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready receyued thy pleaſures,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke. 15.</note> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> likewiſe his paynes in the world: content thy ſelfe, if thou haſt at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time dou any good, as prayed to GOD, or heard his word, thou haſt ben ſufficiently payed for it: thou canſt not paſſe from a vaine pleaſure, to a true and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pleaſure: from temporall richeſſe (which thou didſt abuſe) to an euerlaſting felicitie: from worldly glorie &amp; honour, whiche were thy delites, to a glorie eternall: which as a ſwéete reward is reſerued for this man, on whom the world threw contempt becauſe of his pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Wherein then as the rich men of the worlde haue more occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſubmit in humilitie and feare, ſo, to the poore is giuen comfort and hope to bée exalted, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the more miſeries, perplexities, and contemptes they haue ſuffered in the world, the greater recompence is layed vp, in the ioyes, felicities, and eternall delites of heauen.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing not yet ſpoken of the dutie of a friend but in generall ſort, nor of Chriſtian charitie, wherein conſiſts the perfection of a Chriſtian, and of moſte deare commendacion in the Scripture: it cannot be impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to inferre ſome diſcourſe therof, the neceſſitie of our purpoſe ſo requiring. Amitie is of foure kindes: as naturall, ciuill, carnall (ſuch as was amongſt the Pagans) and Chriſtian or ſpirituall. The two firſt haue their approbation euen by the ſcripture: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third, which is carnall, hath ben by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of good men, reputed corrupt, as in déede it is, and much reproued according to the doctrine of God. Naturall friendſhip, is as the loue of parents towards their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and one kinſman or countrey man to an other: Ciuill amitie, is got either by conuerſation and ſociety of men together: or in reſpect of profites, eyther recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or hoped for: this friendſhip is called of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, humane, and as it were due of common of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: But better is it expreſſed (whereby it is called a vertue morall) when it vnites mutually heartes and willes together, &amp; ſometimes it is but of the one part, which is the cauſe of <hi>Tullies</hi> opinion, that ſuch is the force and propertie of vertue, that it conſtraynes men to loue ſuch, on whom there goeth but an opinion and reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of honeſtie, though they neuer ſaw nor knew the perſons. But notwithſtanding the reaſons and iudgements of the Philoſophers touching that kind of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:2096:192"/> amitie, the Scripture will neuer repute it a vertue, if it haue not a purpoſe and end to the honour and loue of God: without which end, much leſſe that all vertuous actions haue any recompence or glory afore God, but, (with <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi>) that kind of amitie is accompted corrupt,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10 Col. 3.</note> as not done to that end which the Scripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundes: by which we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to do al things for the honour of God. Fleſhly amitie or friendſhip is contracted, vnder a hope or preſent enioying of goods, honours, and carnall pleaſures. And ſometimes the naturall and ciuill amitie degenerate into this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loue, being moſt often the very loue wée beare to our ſelues, deliting more in our owne glory,<note place="margin">Tim. 2.</note> and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, then in GOD, or that concernes our ſaluation: Where vppon it is ſayd, that men vppon the end of the world, ſhalbe ſo worldly and fleſhly (a ſigne of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation) that they ſhalbe more ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t followers of their proper delites, then of God, This loue <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> with good reaſon, ſayth, is the foundation of the Citie of the Deuil, as the loue to God is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground worke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy citie of the ſoueraigne Lord: Chriſtian loue is that charitie which ſo often God recommends to vs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending an entier loue with all our power to him, and a ſincere amitie without fiction to our neighbour, euen by the ſame meaſure, that naturally we loue our ſelues, with this inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement alwayes that all be for the loue &amp; honor of God, (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe &amp; end of al amitie &amp; al our actions) to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end to receiue for it eternal retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, This amitie, leads, directs, &amp; makes perfect, the natural, ciuil, &amp; moral friendſhip, &amp; euen ſo corrects al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together that, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is carnall, as being corrupt by wicked affections, &amp; makes it turne into ſpiritual, by ſpiritual conuerſation: as, if a man louing his wife, onely for that ſhe is faire and riche, and for his beaſtly pleaſure (a Pagan loue and little differing from the affection of a whoremonger to his concubine) and being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:2096:193"/> inſtructed by Chriſtian doctrine, with what zeale he ought to embraſe his wife in mariage: loueth her not for the reaſons of the fleſh aforeſayd, but as his companion of grace, coenheritrice of the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, louing hir with that ſpirituall and true loue wher with Ieſus Chriſt loued his Church: And as a Father louing his ſonne not ſimplie nor naturally, but with a worldly affection, as making him his Idoll falleth to loue him afterwards in God by Chriſtian inſtitution, that is according to the preſcript of the Scripture, kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him in diſcipline and vertuous exerciſe. Thus the whoremonger is conuerted, and forbearing his fleſhly affection to his troll, will hate in him ſelfe and hir all damnable lightnes, and neuer looke on hir but with a diſpleaſure and remorſe of his ſinne: which, after their conuerſion ſhe is alſo bound to do. And if there bée daunger eftſones to fall, they are bound to reſtraine ſight and mutuall company and ſtand vpon their gard, no leſſe then ſuch, as hauing ben once enuenimed with a ſwéete poyſon, &amp; by an antidot preſerued from death, will beware eftſones of charmes or ſwéete liccours: neyther is penaunce of any force, if the ſinne bée not altogether abandoned, and all carnaletie abhorred. And if in déede amitie (to ſpeake more properlye) bée a vertue more then morrall, and not affection onely (according to the error of ſome Philoſophers) it can not be ioyned with vice: for ſo théeues, &amp; other of vice albeit they vaunt of frendſhip in ſuſteyning one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can not truly be called frends, but confederats in league, conſpiring by common conſent to do euill: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie is perpetuall, as is all vertue of his liuely and proper nature: So that ſuch as loue richmen, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the proffites they receiue by them, are not true frindes, for that when ſuch rich men ſhall become pore (which God doeth often ſuffer) they are for ſaken of their frindes, becauſe riches was the only cauſe of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2096:193"/> ſuch frendſhip: and who loues an other, as it were in recompence of affection that he beareth to him, loueth not as he ought, for that the cauſe riſing of bare fancie which afterwardes may chaunge into hate, the frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp can not be certein nor perpetuall: yea he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth an other for his vertue, loues not ſimplie as he ought according to God, for that as the vertue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man enclines to vice, ſo the affection of his frend will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert into hate, for which cauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aloweth the ſentence of a wiſe Philoſopher ſaying, that men ought to loue, but not ſo much, but that they may hate, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that louing men of vertue, and their vertues, torning into vices, our affection may reſume his firſt qualitie, (if for charitie ſake we forbeare to hate them) This was his iudgment of frendes that might chaung by francke and louing will:<note place="margin">Matt. 3. Rom. 5.</note> But by the Goſpell we are warned to loue our ennemies and wicked men, yea Infidels which ſéeke to perſecute vs to death, ſo much are we bound to loue them, as to praye to God for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and to preſent them with our goodes, help, and life, if there be hope of their ſaluation, not ſo much as willing or doing to them any diſpleaſure: ſo did Chriſt loue vs all, and died for vs being his ennemies: The cauſe of this loue is God, for the honor, loue, and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of whome, we loue, louing that which he loueth, according as he loueth, and for what cauſe he loueth, conforming vs wholy to his will and his loue, in the which, and for the which he loueth vs all: Let vs loue therfore that which is of him, as (in man) his Image and ſemblance, his handie worke, his vertues, &amp; his graces, conforming ourſelues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue which he bears him hauing made for him ſo many creaturs, giuen him his Aungells for his protectores and guides, and his only ſonne to death for him, yea euen when man was his enemye, blaſphemed him, and was altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to him: Thus muſt we loue the ſoule of our
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:2096:194"/> neighboure, (albeit he be our ennemie) as the deare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the precious blode of IESVS CHRIST, and his body being the ſacred temple of the holy ghoſt: yea ſo we muſt loue him, as Ieſus Chriſt loued him, giuing his life frankelye for him: whom by baptiſme, as he hath incorporated him, in him ſelfe to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his bodye, and by faith in the holy communion made him his fleſh and blood, ſo I ought to loue him as one of the members of the bodie of this Lord, and as his fleſh and blood: with all, ſeing we are all made by him members of the ſame miſticall bodye, and childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all of one father by ſpirituall adoption, then the ſame affection ought to be conuerſant amongeſt vs, which paſſeth betwéene members of one ſelfe bodye, &amp; proper and naturall brethern: in effect, the friendſhip, that we ought to beare one to another, ought to be without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of perſonnes, counthries, kindred, or parents: w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which zeale if we loue not euen the moſt ſtrangers of the worlde,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> the moſt vnthankefull amongeſt men, and our mortall enemies, we are not the diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> by whome we are tolde, that then we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our ſelues his folowers, when we do that which he commaundes vs: his precept is that we loue one an other, as he hath loued vs, to ſaye and doe well by our enemies, yea to dye for them if néede require, in hope to gaine and ſaue their ſoules, in ſorte as he is deade for ours: So that, who hateth another, beareth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to him, doeth him iniurie ſéeckes reueng of him, ſtrikes him, and (which is extreme iniquitie) killeth him, apertains no more to Ieſus Chriſt, as to beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of on of his diſciples, or of his flock, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wolues Lions, Tigres, are of the heard and flocke of Lambes vnder the charge of a ſhepherd: Suchthen that haue quarrells aſpiringe to combate one againſt another, &amp; practiſe reuenge of wronges by their proper autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, belong nothing to the profeſſion of Chriſt, and in
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2096:194"/> their hartes haue no more taſte of God then Pagans and vnbeleuing <hi>Atheiſts:</hi> He that will offer ſacrifice to God,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. Tit. 3.</note> can not by Ieſus Chriſt make it acceptable to his father, if he haue offended his neyghboure, and is not reconciled, as alſo, who hateth his Brother, is a murderer and ſtands voyde of grace for eternall life: I comprehend not in this, ſuch Chriſtians, as by lawfull iuſtice purſue the reſtitution of their goods, honour, or wrongs, receiued by any wicked men: for, ſéeing iuſtice and iudiciall order is of God, and by him commaunded to procure puniſhment in forme of iuſtice to the wicked acording to their merits, and that by the Magiſtrate &amp; the law, is not onely lawfull but alſo acceptable to god, ſo that it be done without hatred, and affection of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular vengeance, not regarding ſo much our proper benefit, honour, or priuate intereſt, as to correct vices, &amp; by that iuſtice to giue ſuccour to the ſoule of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, to the better ſtay and example of a whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munaltie. This is alſo expreſſed in the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of a body which we go about to purge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> botches, impoſtumes, &amp; boyles: In which body if there be any member ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, that it would infect the others to the daunger of the whole bodie, it is cut of, but with a great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to all the other members, who, by a communion of nature, being conioyned and knit together, do loue one an other with connaturall and perfect zeale. And to retourne to the matter of Chriſtian amitie, we are bound to loue men as God loueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe loue is ſo much the greater towardes them, by how much hée findeth their affection pure to him, and the more doth his zeale increaſe, the more he ſéeth in them that which is his, as faith and charitie, with feruent zeale to his honour, and exerciſe of good déedes: euen ſo, the more faith and ſimplicitie we find in men, the better affected to Gods honour, of a more ready and franke minde to his ſeruice, better diſpoſed to actes of compaſſion, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2096:195"/> aſpiring nearer a deuine perfection of God: euen in ſo much greater affection, honour, and franke mind of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, are we bound to them, as knowing that in that we moſt pleaſe God, who, for thoſe reſpects honoreth them more then others. And therefore we honour nor loue them not ſo much in their perſons, as we expreſſe our ſelues to loue God in them, in whom we honour his giftes and graces, and all that we find to be deuine in them: So that as we are bound in a ſtronger affection and more readines of ſeruice to thoſe whom we know to be men of honeſt integretie, then to others in whom we can acknowledge no ſuch vertues: So, yet we muſt hate no creature according to the example of God, who beareth no malice to any man he hath made,<note place="margin">Iere. 4.</note> as hauing declared therein his power, his wiſedome, and his bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: For which three things we muſt acknowledge his handy worke with thankes giuing. Beſides, we know that God is not but charitie and loue, and who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in charitie, dwelleth in God, and God is firme in him: as of the contrary, who hateth any man, hath no perfect charitie, and by concluſion cannot be of God: So that as we are firſt bound to loue GOD with all our heartes, ſo in the ſecond place we ought for his ſake to loue al men with a true &amp; perpetual loue as our ſelues. But if we find them poſſeſſed with any vice or faulte, lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing ſtill the creature, we may hate that which we ſée not to be of God and hated of men, as knowing that in God there is nothing but integretie and what els is good and vertuous. Theſe be the cauſes why we ought to loue the ſoules and bodies of ſinners as being the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die workes of God: but lawfully maye we hate their ſinnes and wicked condicions, as we ought not to loue any thing in the Deuill, but his creation, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, ſince, touching the reſt, he is nothing but peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, of his proper will: for which cauſe he is called wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as not taking pleaſure no (which is worſe) not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:2096:195"/> power to delite in any thing but to do euill, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame being the reaſon, why ſo often we are commaunded to ſhonne him, and not to ſuffer him to enter into vs by any pleaſant ſuggeſtion, but to reſiſt him, &amp; eſtéeme him our onely enemie, a ſerpent and venemous Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, a rauining Wolfe, a roaring Lion, a théefe and murderer, ſéeking after nothing but by ſuttletie, force, ambuſhes, and treaſons, to betray our ſoules: yea, if it were not by his wicked and wretched temptations, we ſhould neuer haue enemies, malice, or miſeries, no, not once haue the thought to do wrong one to another, the ſame being the cauſe that our ſauiour Chriſt calles him our enemie: it is he only whom we ought to hate,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> and all that is in him (except the ſpirituall ſubſtance, the firſt creature of God) it is he onely whom we ought ſo much to deteſt, as not once to hear him, ſée him, or ſéeke to learne any thing of him, in whom is nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, lying, abuſe, and murder: it is he, of whom wée ought to take nothing that he offreth, for he corrupteth all that he giueth: And ſéeing he is a poyſoner, let vs alwayes take héede that he enuenime not our thoughts with vaine and wicked pleaſure, with infidelitie &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to euill: and that he poyſon not our wordes, with vanitie, iniuries, detraction, lies, falſe othes, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie: nor infect our workes or actions with ipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or diſſembled intention, nor by any other trangreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods commaundements. This wicked ſpirite hath ſtretched out his ſnares in all places, and diſperſed his poyſon throughout the worlde: he entrapped <hi>Eue</hi> in the earthly paradiſe, and poyſoned hir with luſt of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which, as an infection hee hath earſt diſtilled into infinit nations and perſons: his ginnes are ſo ſuttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought and layd, that they are eſpied and auoyded of none, but ſuch as are humble and lowly ſuch as liue in continuall contemplation of Gods wiſedome and his holy feare, ſuch as reſolued into ſpirite, haue no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:2096:196"/> with the fleſh and the world: ſuch as are ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in fayth and of that immouable loue to God, that they take no other pleaſure but to do his commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements: Suche doeth the ſpirit and wiſdome of God inſtruct to eſpie and breake his ſuttle ſnares, and giue them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt the poyſon of that venemous baſiliſke. Touching amitie cyuill which we get by ſocietie of ſtudie, by coniunction of life, and ſimilitude of eſtates and functions, or in recompence of benefits: we may conioyne it with the Chriſtian amitie, by the which it hath his confirmation, and is made better and more agreable to God: By this, if I loue better him that is thus my frend, then an other profeſſed vnto me by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſtian amitie: I do no wronge to no Chriſtian fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I take nothing from him of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is his, I mean of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which I owe him in true &amp; ſpiritual loue: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue natural is not deminiſhed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amitie but is made more firme &amp; ſpiritual as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Father louing better his owne ſonne, then an other childe, forgetts not for all that to expreſſe effectes of Chriſtian amitie to the other: So that by this loue, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, kindred, and Chriſtian neighbours, may loue one an other with greater loue, and yet do no wronge to others touching the zeale which they ought to beare them, as we ſée by the compariſon of the fier (where in is reſembled charitie and perfect Chriſtian loue) which béegins firſt to heat and burne thoſe thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are preſented neareſt to it: I will not hold for all this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in caſe of election of a magiſtrate, friendſhip is to be expreſſed, for that there perticuler amitie ſhoulde giue place to publike friendſhip as where is more neede of vertue, veritie, and iuſtice, then of ſinguler loue onely: for as vertue (being deuine) is and ought to to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred afore all humaine affections: So he, in whome is moſt reputation of wiſdome, learning, 'integritie &amp; iuſtice, although he ſtand to vs neyther in parentage

And this, albeit can not be done without extréeme ſorrow to our whole common weale, but ſpecially to the next parentes, neighbours, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars, yet being driuen thereunto for the health and ſauetie of the whole, the neceſſitie makes the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraint neyther hatefull nor intollerable.

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:2096:198"/> wherein is not to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that naturally the head of man findes out ſpéedely the griefe or diſeaſe of the member to giue ſuccours to it: the ſame being an aduertiſement that the chief ruler or head of a common weale, ought alſo to know the euill that is happened in any place of his gouernement, whereunto he is bounde with his eyes, his eares, his vnderſtanding, and all his other ſenſible ſynowes, I meane officers inferiour, to whom belonges the information of euery thing, to the end reaſonable remedie may be applied: But this were a great euill, if the head ſhould become diſeaſed by vices and peruerſed affections: for being ſo, he would make to languiſh all his poore body, and leade the members into diſorder: yea worſe would happen, if any groſſe or corrupt humour, hindered or ſtopped the naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duites, by the which the liuely ſpirites procéeding from the braine could not pearce and paſſe thorough all the partes of the body, whereby it might fall by <hi>apoplexie</hi> as dead, without ſpéeche, without mouing of breath, and ſéeme to haue no ſence. In this we ſignifie, that if the law (which is as the ſoule of the body ciuill) be in the head of the magiſtrat, reſtrayned or hindred by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or aboundance of humores infected (as couetouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hate, feare, loue, and falſe opinion touching religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to performe her frée functions through all the ſaied body pollitike in motions and ſenſes (which are gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements) by wyſe prouidence, equitie and iuſtice. The poore common weale can not but fall quickly to the ground, euen as a houſe hath no meane to ſtand, when his proppes are taken from vnder him. This we reade happened in the time of <hi>Sedechias</hi> king of <hi>Jſraell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hier. 20.</note> when the great Sacrificator <hi>Phaſſur</hi> and all his vnder ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators and Prophetes (except <hi>Jeremie, EZechiell, Daniel,</hi> and a few others) togither with their king, and his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, were occupied in actes of couetouſnes, rapines, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, and pagan ſuperſtitions, and forhearing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
